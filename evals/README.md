# Skill Evals

This repo uses [BenchFlow](https://github.com/benchflow-ai/benchflow) for skill
evals. Each skill owns its eval cases at:

```text
skills/<skill>/evals/evals.json
```

The local `evals/` directory is intentionally thin: it loads local Omni/model
credentials, substitutes instance-specific placeholders, materializes temporary
BenchFlow tasks, and runs with-skill/baseline jobs.

A BenchFlow run needs a live Omni instance and takes about twenty minutes, so it
is not what gates a pull request. Two cheaper tiers do that — see
[`ci/README.md`](ci/README.md): `ci/validate.py` (structural checks, no model
calls, no credentials) and `ci/routing_eval.py` (does each eval question route to
the skill that owns it). Run them before you run this one.

## Eval Schema

Eval files use BenchFlow's skill-eval schema:

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "skill_name": "omni-query",
  "defaults": {
    "timeout_sec": 1200,
    "judge_model": "claude-sonnet-4-6"
  },
  "cases": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "question": "What query powers the Revenue Overview dashboard tile?",
      "ground_truth": "The agent extracts the tile query definition.",
      "expected_behavior": [
        "The agent calls omni documents get-queries",
        "The agent reports fields, filters, and sorts"
      ],
      "expected_skill": "omni-query"
    }
  ]
}
```

`{{EVAL_*}}` placeholders are resolved from `evals/eval-env.local.json` at run
time so committed eval cases stay instance-neutral.

The local runner also supports a repo-only `files` key on source cases. It is
stripped before BenchFlow schema validation, then the declared files are copied
into the generated task at `/app/evals/<filename>` for agents to read.

## Local Configuration

Install BenchFlow with token telemetry support:

```bash
uv tool install 'benchflow @ git+https://github.com/benchflow-ai/benchflow.git@main'
```

Or let the runner use `uv run --with "$BENCHFLOW_PACKAGE"` automatically if
`uv` is available. By default `BENCHFLOW_PACKAGE` points at BenchFlow `main` so
token telemetry from BenchFlow PR #289 is captured. Override it in
`evals/.env.local` after a released package includes the same support:

```dotenv
BENCHFLOW_PACKAGE=benchflow
```

Create local runtime env:

```bash
cp evals/.env.example evals/.env.local
```

Set the model credentials your selected agent and judge need:

```dotenv
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
EVAL_AGENT=claude-agent-acp
EVAL_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-6
EVAL_SANDBOX=docker
```

Set Omni credentials in `evals/.env.local`; the runner passes them into the
BenchFlow sandbox:

```dotenv
OMNI_BASE_URL=https://your-instance.example/
OMNI_API_TOKEN=...
```

Local instance identifiers still live in:

```bash
cp evals/eval-env.json evals/eval-env.local.json
```

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for the required dashboards, model fields, branch IDs,
users, labels, and schedules.

## Running Evals

Run one skill:

```bash
./evals/runner.sh omni-query
```

Run one case:

```bash
./evals/runner.sh omni-query --case 1
```

Run without baseline:

```bash
./evals/runner.sh omni-query --case 1 --no-baseline
```

Run all skills:

```bash
./evals/runner.sh all
```

Typical full clean run from the repo root:

```bash
./evals/reset.sh
./evals/runner.sh all --preflight-only
./evals/runner.sh all --concurrency 15 --timeout-sec 1200
```

After the run finishes, export the trend history:

```bash
./evals/history.sh --format csv > evals/eval-history.csv
./evals/history.sh --format jsonl > evals/eval-history.jsonl
```

Common options:

```bash
./evals/runner.sh omni-query \
  --agent claude-agent-acp \
  --model claude-sonnet-4-6 \
  --sandbox docker \
  --concurrency 1 \
  --timeout-sec 1200
```

The runner defaults to one retry per case (`--max-retries 1`) to absorb
transient sandbox or provider failures. For a single skill, `--concurrency`
limits concurrent cases for that skill. For `all`, it is a global case budget
spread across skills, so `all --concurrency 15` can run multiple skills at once
instead of processing skills strictly one by one. Higher concurrency can make
local Docker runs faster, but if Docker reports compose/network setup errors,
rerun with lower concurrency.

The runner materializes tasks with a 1200 second wall-clock budget by default
(`--timeout-sec`, or `EVAL_TIMEOUT_SEC` in `evals/.env.local`). This is higher
than the committed per-skill schema defaults because full Omni workflows can
spend several minutes discovering model/content context before producing the
scored answer.

Before starting BenchFlow, the runner performs cheap, read-only Omni preflight
checks for selected cases with known mutable remote fixtures. If a fixture is
dirty, the run exits before any LLM tokens are spent. The runner does **not**
run `reset.sh` automatically because reset deletes/recreates mutable eval
fixtures. Run it explicitly when you want cleanup, then rerun preflight.

Current preflight checks verify that `omni-admin` case 4 can see the `region`
user attribute definition, `omni-content-builder` case 2 is pointed at a clean
Sales Performance dashboard, and `omni-model-builder` cases 1, 2, and 4 have
usable model fixtures. Run `./evals/reset.sh` for best-effort cleanup, then
rerun preflight. Some failures require manual fixture recreation or removal;
fix Omni connectivity or credentials first when relevant, then follow the
specific preflight message and `evals/SETUP.md` when reset cannot clean them
safely.

To check readiness without starting BenchFlow:

```bash
./evals/runner.sh all --preflight-only
```

The runner adds a short Omni auth hint to each materialized task: credentials
are available as `OMNI_BASE_URL` and `OMNI_API_TOKEN`, so agents can use CLI
flags when the sandbox has no Omni config file.

## Outputs

Runs are written under:

```text
evals/workspaces/benchflow/<skill>/<timestamp>/
```

Important files:

```text
summary.json                              Combined with-skill/baseline summary
jobs/with-skill/summary.json             BenchFlow aggregate for with-skill
jobs/baseline/summary.json               BenchFlow aggregate for baseline
jobs/<mode>/<run>/<case>/result.json      Per-case score, errors, token totals
jobs/<mode>/<run>/<case>/timing.json      Phase timings
jobs/<mode>/<run>/<case>/prompts.json     Prompt sent to the agent
jobs/<mode>/<run>/<case>/trajectory/      ACP/provider trajectories
jobs/<mode>/<run>/<case>/verifier/        Reward and verifier stdout
```

BenchFlow reports provider token telemetry (`input`, `output`, cache read, cache
creation, total) and timing when the resolved BenchFlow package includes token
telemetry support. The default runner package points at BenchFlow `main` for
that support until it is available in a normal release. BenchFlow does not
compute the old local harness' task-vs-overhead attribution.

## History

Export a flat CSV across all timestamped runs:

```bash
./evals/history.sh > eval-history.csv
```

Or JSONL:

```bash
./evals/history.sh --format jsonl > eval-history.jsonl
```

Rows include skill, mode (`with_skill`, `baseline`, or `lift`), agent, model,
case ids, pass/fail counts, score, timing, token totals when BenchFlow captured
them, and the source job directory. This is the lightweight equivalent of an
over-time report: commit no run artifacts, but archive or load this export into
BI when you want longitudinal views.

CSV fields:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `run_id` | Stable id for the runner invocation. All skills in one `./evals/runner.sh all ...` run share this value. Older summaries without a stored id are backfilled as `legacy-YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS` by grouping near-simultaneous skill workspaces. |
| `run_started_at` | Run start timestamp in `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S` format, normalized from the workspace directory name for CSV import tools. |
| `skill_name` | Skill evaluated, matching the directory under `skills/`. |
| `mode` | `with_skill`, `baseline`, or `lift`. |
| `agent` | BenchFlow agent used for the rollout, for example `claude-agent-acp`. |
| `model` | Model used by the agent rollout. |
| `sandbox` | BenchFlow environment type, usually `docker`. |
| `cases` | Comma-separated case ids included in the run. |
| `total` | Number of cases in the mode summary. Empty for `lift` rows. |
| `passed` | Number of cases BenchFlow marked passed. Empty for `lift` rows. |
| `failed` | Number of cases BenchFlow marked failed. Empty for `lift` rows. |
| `errored` | Number of agent/runtime errors. Empty for `lift` rows. |
| `verifier_errored` | Number of verifier errors. Empty for `lift` rows. |
| `score` | BenchFlow score string, usually a percentage. |
| `score_pct` | Numeric score percentage. For `lift` rows, this is the with-skill score minus baseline score in percentage points. |
| `efficiency_adjusted_score_pct` | Experimental score for rollout rows only: `score_pct` minus transparent efficiency penalties for high tokens per case and timeouts. Use this for optimization triage, not as the canonical pass rate. |
| `efficiency_penalty_pct` | Percentage-point penalty applied to `score_pct` for `efficiency_adjusted_score_pct`. Current policy: no token penalty up to 1M tokens/case, capped token penalty above that, plus timeout penalties capped separately. |
| `elapsed_sec` | Mode elapsed seconds from BenchFlow. Empty for `lift` rows. |
| `total_tool_calls` | Sum of agent tool calls across result files for the rollout. Empty for `lift` rows and older/incomplete artifacts. |
| `avg_tool_calls` | Average tool calls per case for the rollout. Use to spot tool churn and looping behavior. |
| `total_prompts` | Sum of agent prompt turns across result files for the rollout. |
| `avg_prompts` | Average prompt turns per case for the rollout. |
| `avg_case_duration_sec` | Average per-case wall-clock duration derived from result timestamps. This complements `elapsed_sec`, which is the whole mode runtime. |
| `timeout_count` | Number of cases whose agent error included a wall-clock budget timeout. |
| `total_input_tokens` | Provider-reported non-cache input tokens. |
| `total_output_tokens` | Provider-reported output tokens. |
| `total_cache_read_tokens` | Provider-reported cache read tokens. |
| `total_cache_creation_tokens` | Provider-reported cache creation/write tokens. |
| `total_tokens` | Sum of reported input, output, cache read, and cache creation tokens. |
| `tokens_per_case` | `total_tokens / total`. Use for efficiency comparisons within a skill/case mix. |
| `tokens_per_pass` | `total_tokens / passed`. Useful for cost-to-success views; empty when `passed` is zero. |
| `total_cost_usd` | Cost reported by BenchFlow, when available. This may be `0.0` if BenchFlow lacks pricing for the model. |
| `job_dir` | Local path to the source BenchFlow run workspace. |

JSONL uses the same logical fields as the CSV export, with one JSON object per
row. `with_skill` and `baseline` rows include rollout metrics, token telemetry,
and timing. `lift` rows are comparison rows and intentionally omit fields that
do not apply to a single rollout, such as pass/fail counts, elapsed time, and
tokens.

JSONL field descriptions:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `run_id` | Stable id for one eval runner invocation. Use this to group every skill and mode row from a single `./evals/runner.sh all ...` run, even when individual skill workspaces have different timestamps. |
| `run_started_at` | Human-readable local start timestamp derived from the BenchFlow workspace directory, formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`. Use it for sorting and display; use `run_id` for grouping. |
| `skill_name` | Skill under test, matching a directory under `skills/`. Use this as the main dimension for per-skill trend charts. |
| `mode` | Row type: `with_skill` is the agent with the skill loaded, `baseline` is the comparison run without the skill, and `lift` is the score delta between them. |
| `agent` | BenchFlow agent adapter used for the rollout, for example `claude-agent-acp`. Use this to separate results if the harness starts testing different agent adapters. |
| `model` | Model used by the rollout. Use this to avoid comparing scores or token usage across model changes without labeling the change. |
| `sandbox` | BenchFlow execution environment, usually `docker`. Useful for spotting changes caused by local versus container execution. |
| `cases` | Comma-separated list of eval case ids included in the row. Use this to confirm two rows are comparable before comparing scores. |
| `total` | Number of cases evaluated for a rollout row. Omitted on `lift` rows because lift compares two rollouts rather than running cases itself. |
| `passed` | Number of cases that received a passing reward in that rollout. Omitted on `lift` rows. |
| `failed` | Number of cases that did not pass in that rollout. Omitted on `lift` rows. |
| `errored` | Number of cases with agent/runtime errors, such as wall-clock timeout. Track separately from failed rubric scores because these point to harness or execution issues. |
| `verifier_errored` | Number of cases where the verifier failed. Treat these as eval infrastructure issues before treating them as skill quality signals. |
| `score` | BenchFlow score string, usually a percentage such as `75.0%`. Good for display, but prefer `score_pct` for calculations. |
| `score_pct` | Numeric score percentage. For `with_skill` and `baseline`, this is the rollout score; for `lift`, this is `with_skill score - baseline score` in percentage points. |
| `efficiency_adjusted_score_pct` | Experimental rollout score after subtracting efficiency penalties from `score_pct`. Keep it separate from correctness reporting; use it to prioritize optimization work and GEPA objectives. |
| `efficiency_penalty_pct` | Total percentage-point efficiency penalty. Token penalties start only above 1M tokens per case and are capped; timeout penalties are additive and separately capped. |
| `elapsed_sec` | Wall-clock seconds for a rollout mode. Use this for runtime trends and timeout investigation. Omitted on `lift` rows. |
| `total_tool_calls` | Total agent tool calls across the rollout's case result files. High values often indicate exploration, retries, or tool-output loops. |
| `avg_tool_calls` | Tool calls divided by case count. Use this as a normalized tool-churn metric within comparable case sets. |
| `total_prompts` | Total agent prompt turns across case result files. Most current evals should be near one prompt per case. |
| `avg_prompts` | Prompt turns divided by case count. Spikes suggest multi-turn recovery, retries, or harness behavior changes. |
| `avg_case_duration_sec` | Average case runtime computed from each `result.json` start/finish timestamp. Use alongside `elapsed_sec` to understand serial versus parallel runtime. |
| `timeout_count` | Count of agent executions that hit the configured wall-clock budget. Treat these as efficiency and reliability failures even when other cases pass. |
| `total_input_tokens` | Provider-reported non-cache input tokens for the rollout. Can be `null` for older runs without telemetry. |
| `total_output_tokens` | Provider-reported output tokens for the rollout. Use with input/cache fields to understand token shape. |
| `total_cache_read_tokens` | Provider-reported prompt-cache read tokens. High values here usually indicate repeated shared prompt/context reuse rather than new paid input. |
| `total_cache_creation_tokens` | Provider-reported prompt-cache creation/write tokens. Spikes can indicate larger prompts, tool results, or skill context being cached. |
| `total_tokens` | Sum of input, output, cache read, and cache creation tokens reported by BenchFlow. Use this for broad consumption trends, not precise billing unless pricing is separately applied. |
| `tokens_per_case` | Total reported tokens divided by number of cases. Compare within the same skill or case mix, not across unrelated skills. |
| `tokens_per_pass` | Total reported tokens divided by passed cases. Useful for cost-to-success dashboards; omitted when nothing passed. |
| `total_cost_usd` | Cost reported by BenchFlow when available. This may be `0.0` or `null` if BenchFlow does not have pricing for the model. |
| `job_dir` | Local source workspace for the run artifacts. Use this to drill from a trend row back into detailed case results, trajectories, and verifier output. |

## GEPA

GEPA is used here in two different ways:

1. Export scored traces from completed `./evals/runner.sh` workspaces for later
   analysis or optimizer input.
2. Run a real optimization loop that proposes candidate `SKILL.md` edits and
   evaluates each candidate with BenchFlow.

BenchFlow's native `bench skills eval --export-gepa` path can export traces
when running through the BenchFlow CLI directly. This repo's day-to-day eval
entrypoint is `./evals/runner.sh`, so the preferred local export path is
`./evals/gepa_export.sh`, which reuses existing runner artifacts and does not
spend model tokens.

GEPA is pinned in `evals/requirements-gepa.txt` and kept out of the default
eval dependency set, since the entry points below are opt-in. The real skill
optimizer also carries uv inline script metadata for its extra dependencies
(`benchflow`, `litellm`, and `anthropic`), so `uv run` can provision them
without repeating a long `--with ...` list.

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r evals/requirements-gepa.txt
```

### Which path to use

| Goal | Command | Calls models? | Calls Omni? |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| Export existing scored traces | `./evals/gepa_export.sh <run>` | No | No |
| Verify GEPA is installed and the reflection loop works | `python3 evals/lib/gepa_smoke.py` | No by default | No |
| Optimize a skill against eval cases | `uv run evals/lib/gepa_skill_optimize.py ...` | Yes | Yes, through BenchFlow evals |
| Visualize a GEPA run | `python3 evals/lib/gepa_report.py <run>` | No | No |

### Export traces from existing runs

Use this when you already have a completed eval run and want GEPA-shaped data
without rerunning anything.

Exports scored case traces from an existing runner workspace. This does not run
BenchFlow, call a model, or touch Omni; it reads `summary.json`, generated task
case files, `result.json`, `prompts.json`, verifier output, agent logs, and ACP
trajectory JSONL from a completed eval run.

```bash
./evals/gepa_export.sh omni-query/2026-05-25__09-20-40
```

The argument can be an absolute workspace path, `skill/timestamp`, or a unique
timestamp under `evals/workspaces/benchflow`. By default the exporter writes:

```text
evals/workspaces/benchflow/<skill>/<timestamp>/gepa/
  skill.md
  summary.json
  traces/<case>-with-skill.json
```

Useful options:

| Flag | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `--output-dir` | `<run>/gepa` | Write export somewhere else. |
| `--mode` | `with-skill` | Repeatable; also supports `baseline` when that mode exists. |
| `--trajectory-limit` | `120000` | Max chars copied from each trajectory file; use `full` or `--full` for no truncation. |
| `--verifier-limit` | `40000` | Max chars copied from verifier stdout/reward text. |
| `--agent-log-limit` | `40000` | Max chars copied from agent log text files. |
| `--include-skill-text` | off | Embed full `SKILL.md` in every trace. By default it is written once as `skill.md`. |

Example exporting both modes from a full run:

```bash
./evals/gepa_export.sh \
  omni-query/2026-05-25__06-44-22 \
  --mode with-skill \
  --mode baseline
```

### Smoke test

A deterministic local check of GEPA's `optimize_anything` reflection loop.
Spends no model tokens and does not touch Omni: a `StatefulReflectionStub`
returns a partial-then-full candidate sequence and asserts that each reflection
prompt was assembled with the filled `<curr_param>` / `<side_info>`
placeholders, the evaluator's Actionable Side Information markers
(`Found` / `Missing` / `Feedback`), and the previously selected candidate
text. Exits non-zero if the engine ran only one metric call, failed to beat
the seed, or did not reach the perfect score — i.e. it fails loudly when the
reflection loop short-circuits.

```bash
python3 evals/lib/gepa_smoke.py
```

By default it writes to `evals/workspaces/gepa-smoke/<timestamp>/` and refuses
to reuse an existing run directory unless `--keep-run-dir` is passed.

To exercise a real reflection model instead of the local stub (spends tokens),
pass a LiteLLM model string or opt in to the BenchFlow `EVAL_MODEL` bridge:

```bash
python3 evals/lib/gepa_smoke.py --reflection-model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
GEPA_USE_EVAL_MODEL=1 python3 evals/lib/gepa_smoke.py
```

To inspect what GEPA tried, generate a Markdown report with candidate scores,
mutation excerpts, and a Mermaid flowchart:

```bash
python3 evals/lib/gepa_report.py evals/workspaces/gepa-smoke/<timestamp>
```

### Optimize a skill

Optimizes a real `SKILL.md` against one or more BenchFlow eval cases. Each
candidate is materialized as a temporary skill copy, run through the same
BenchFlow path used by `runner.sh` (with-skill mode only, no baseline), and
scored by the average per-case reward. Per-case verifier output, the head of
the ACP trajectory, and the full eval-case definitions are returned to GEPA
as side information so the reflection LM has the same context the judge used.

Real run (real tokens, real Omni instance, BenchFlow sandbox per metric call):

> **Data boundary:** the optimizer sends candidate `SKILL.md` text plus
> evaluator side information to the configured reflection model. That side
> information includes eval-case definitions, verifier output, and trajectory
> excerpts, which can contain Omni-derived result data or command output. Run it
> only on cases and traces approved for the configured model provider.

```bash
uv run evals/lib/gepa_skill_optimize.py \
  --skill omni-content-builder --case 1 --max-metric-calls 4
```

Recommended first real run:

```bash
uv run evals/lib/gepa_skill_optimize.py \
  --skill omni-query \
  --case 6 \
  --max-metric-calls 2
```

This evaluates the seed skill once, asks GEPA for one reflected candidate, and
evaluates that candidate once. It is enough to verify that the loop can consume
real BenchFlow feedback before spending more tokens on a broader case set.

Use failing or partial cases for real optimization signal. If the current
`SKILL.md` already passes every selected case, GEPA can still exercise the loop
and produce side-information diffs, but meaningful lift is unlikely.

Key flags:

| Flag | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `--skill` | `omni-ai-eval` | Skill name; reads `skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` as the seed. |
| `--case` | `1` (repeatable) | Eval case IDs to score against. |
| `--max-metric-calls` | `2` | Each call evaluates one candidate via BenchFlow. Keep small — every call is a full case run. |
| `--reflection-model` | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` | Override with `GEPA_REFLECTION_MODEL` env. |
| `--timeout-sec` | `1200` | Per-case wall-clock budget, matches `runner.sh`. |

Each candidate is written under
`evals/workspaces/gepa-skill-optimize/<skill>/<timestamp>/candidate-*/`; the
winning candidate is written to `best_SKILL.md` alongside `summary.json` and
the GEPA engine state in `gepa-state/`.

After a run, create the same candidate/score/mutation report:

```bash
python3 evals/lib/gepa_report.py evals/workspaces/gepa-skill-optimize/<skill>/<timestamp>
```

Note on instance cleanup: GEPA reruns the same case once per metric call, so
fixture-mutating cases (e.g. `omni-content-builder` case 2 against the Sales
Performance dashboard, `omni-model-builder` cases that create model branches)
should be reset between GEPA runs via `./evals/reset.sh`. Cases that create
fresh content per run (`omni-content-builder` case 1 builds a new dashboard
each iteration) leave stray artifacts behind that `reset.sh` will not clean.
