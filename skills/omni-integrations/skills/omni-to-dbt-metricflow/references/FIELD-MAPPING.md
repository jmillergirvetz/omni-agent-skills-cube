# Omni → MetricFlow Field Mapping

Use the effective Omni `combined` YAML. Do not export fields with dbt provenance comments.

Worked example. The examples below use an e-commerce model: Omni view `omni_dbt_ecomm__order_items` backed by dbt model `order_items`, joined to `omni_dbt_ecomm__users` on `user_id`. Replace the view, model, column, and entity names with your own.

Use [YAML-REFERENCE.md](./YAML-REFERENCE.md) for the equivalent dbt 1.12 flattened form.

## Entities and View Mapping

```yaml
# Omni relationship
- join_from_view: omni_dbt_ecomm__order_items
  join_to_view: omni_dbt_ecomm__users
  relationship_type: assumed_many_to_one
  on_sql: ${omni_dbt_ecomm__order_items.user_id} = ${omni_dbt_ecomm__users.id}
```

```yaml
# models/semantic-models/sem_order_items.yml
semantic_models:
  - name: sem_order_items
    model: ref('order_items')
    entities:
      - name: order_item_id
        type: primary
        expr: id
      - name: user_id
        type: foreign
        expr: user_id
```

The many side gets the foreign entity. The one side gets the primary entity. Use the FK column name when it is unambiguous. A composite primary key needs a stable dbt expression.

## Dimensions

```yaml
# Omni
dimensions:
  status:
    sql: '"STATUS"'
  created_at:
    type: time
    timeframes: [raw, date, week, month, quarter, year]
```

```yaml
# MetricFlow output (legacy)
defaults:
  agg_time_dimension: created_at
dimensions:
  - name: status
    type: categorical
  - name: created_at
    type: time
    type_params:
      time_granularity: day
```

### Week start day

Omni `week_start_day` (model or topic) has no MetricFlow equivalent. MetricFlow's standard `week` renders `DATE_TRUNC('week', …)`, `ISOWEEK` on BigQuery. That is Monday on every adapter except Snowflake, where it follows the `WEEK_START` session parameter, Monday by default ([metricflow #792](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/792)). If Omni `week_start_day` is Monday, no action is needed. The documented answer is a custom granularity on the time spine (dbt 1.9+, [MetricFlow time spine](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/metricflow-time-spine)); dbt Labs confirmed on [metricflow #820](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/820) that this covers a non-Monday week start.

Before you add anything, find the project's time spine: `grep -rn "time_spine:" models/` and read its `custom_granularities` list and the model SQL. If a granularity already starts the week on the Omni day (a name such as `week_sun`, `fiscal_week`, or `retail_week`), reuse its name and add no column. If one exists with a different start day, do not change it; add a new one with a new name.

Do not build the custom column with the adapter's `DATE_TRUNC('week', …)`: dbt-bigquery's `date_trunc` macro emits `WEEK` (Sunday), and Snowflake's follows the `WEEK_START` session parameter. Count days from a fixed anchor date that falls on the Omni week start instead. The expression below uses only dbt cross-db macros and `mod`, so it gives the same buckets on every adapter.

```sql
-- metricflow_time_spine.sql: Saturday-start week. 1970-01-03 is a Saturday.
{% set anchor = "cast('1970-01-03' as date)" %}
select date_day,
       cast({{ dbt.dateadd('day', "-1 * mod(mod(" ~ dbt.datediff(anchor, 'date_day', 'day') ~ ", 7) + 7, 7)", 'date_day') }} as date) as week_sat
from ...
```

| Omni `week_start_day` | anchor |
|---|---|
| Monday | 1970-01-05 |
| Tuesday | 1970-01-06 |
| Wednesday | 1970-01-07 |
| Thursday | 1970-01-08 |
| Friday | 1970-01-09 |
| Saturday | 1970-01-03 |
| Sunday | 1970-01-04 |

```yaml
models:
  - name: metricflow_time_spine
    time_spine:
      standard_granularity_column: date_day
      custom_granularities:
        - name: week_sat           # `week` is reserved; use a new name
          column_name: week_sat
    columns:
      - name: date_day
        granularity: day
      - name: week_sat
```

Query with `--group-by metric_time__week_sat`; in a saved query use `"TimeDimension('metric_time', 'week_sat')"`. MetricFlow joins the fact rows to the spine on day and groups by the custom column. The dbt docs say offsets and period-over-period on custom granularities are "coming soon"; in MetricFlow 0.213 a derived metric with `offset_window: 1 week_sat` parsed and returned the previous week's value. Test it on the project's version before you rely on it. Tell the user that every MetricFlow weekly grouping must use the custom name instead of `metric_time__week`. Omni's weekly results do not change after fallback: the Omni query planner applies `week_start_day` itself and does not read the dbt time spine.

Use the finest matching timeframe. `raw` and `date` map to `day`. Calendar parts such as `month_name` have no MetricFlow equivalent.

For a same-view computed dimension, use a dbt expression.

```yaml
dimensions:
  - name: status_complete
    type: categorical
    expr: "case when status = 'Complete' then true else false end"
```

Do not map a cross-view expression.

## Dimension Overrides and Measures

Measure `expr` is written against dbt model columns. It is not written against a model-layer Omni dimension override.

```yaml
# Omni extension
dimensions:
  sale_price:
    sql: '"SALE_PRICE" * 0.95'
```

> ✋ **STOP** — If a measure references `sale_price`, show this override. Choose one of these options:
>
> 1. Materialize the override in the dbt model SQL as a column. Export the measure against that column. (A semantic dimension `expr` does not work here: a measure `expr` reads the physical column, and one that names a dimension fails at query time.)
> 2. Inline the override into the dbt measure `expr` for dbt correctness. Record that the Omni dimension override must be removed in the fallback step.
> 3. Skip the measure.

Never inline an override silently. In dbt, `sale_price` in `expr` reads the raw column. On import, Omni rewrites each column name in `expr` to the Omni dimension of the same name, so `sale_price * 0.95` becomes `${view.sale_price} * 0.95`. If Omni still defines the `sale_price` dimension as `"SALE_PRICE" * 0.95`, the returned measure evaluates `SUM("SALE_PRICE" * 0.95 * 0.95)`.

Option 2 is illustrated by this worked example:

```yaml
measures:
  - name: total_sale_price
    label: Total Sale Price
    description: Total USD amount sold
    agg: sum
    expr: sale_price * 0.95
    create_metric: true
```

It is a valid dbt example. In Omni it is correct only after the matching Omni dimension override has been removed.

## Aggregations

```yaml
# MetricFlow output (legacy)
measures:
  - name: total_sale_price
    label: Total Sale Price
    description: Total USD amount sold
    agg: sum
    expr: sale_price * 0.95
    create_metric: true
  - name: order_id_count_distinct
    label: Order Count
    agg: count_distinct
    expr: order_id
    create_metric: true
  - name: order_item_count
    agg: count
    expr: 1
```

| Omni `aggregate_type` | MetricFlow `agg` | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `sum` | `sum` | Use dbt-column expression. |
| `count` | `count` | Use `expr: 1` when Omni has no SQL. |
| `count_distinct` | `count_distinct` | Use the dbt column. |
| `average` | `average` | Same-view filter: predicate inside `expr`. Cross-view filter: atomic measure plus metric. |
| `min`, `max`, `median` | same | Supported aggregation. |
| `percentile` | `percentile` | Convert 0–100 to 0–1 in `agg_params.percentile`. |
| `sum_distinct_on`, `average_distinct_on`, `median_distinct_on`, `percentile_distinct_on` | none | Skip and report. Omni dedupes by `custom_primary_key_sql`; MetricFlow has no equivalent. |
| `list` | none | Skip and report. |
| measure with `sql` and no `aggregate_type` (custom aggregate) | none | Skip and report unless the SQL is plain arithmetic over other measures (derived metric). |

## Same-View Filter → Predicate Inside `expr`

For any aggregate with a same-view filter, put the predicate in the expression and omit the metric `filter`. Every row is scanned, so a group with no matching rows stays present with the same value as Omni: 0 for `count`, `count_distinct`, and `sum`, NULL for `average`, `min`, `max`, `median`, and `percentile`. Forms:

| Omni aggregate | `expr` |
|---|---|
| `count` | `CASE WHEN <predicate> THEN 1 END` |
| `sum` | `CASE WHEN <predicate> THEN <column> ELSE 0 END` |
| `count_distinct`, `average`, `min`, `max`, `median`, `percentile` | `CASE WHEN <predicate> THEN <column> END` |

```yaml
# Omni
measures:
  count_copy:
    label: Returned Count
    aggregate_type: count
    filters:
      is_returned:
        is: true
```

```yaml
# MetricFlow output (legacy)
measures:
  - name: count_copy
    label: Returned Count
    agg: count
    expr: CASE WHEN is_returned IS TRUE THEN 1 END
    create_metric: true
```

On re-import, Omni creates a measure of the same aggregate type with that `sql`, which is the SQL Omni generates for a filtered measure itself. A cross-view predicate cannot go inside `expr`; use the next section.

## Cross-View Filter → Atomic Measure Plus Simple Metric

Use an atomic measure plus a user-facing metric when the predicate crosses a view. MetricFlow applies the `filter` before aggregation, so a group with no matching rows is absent when the metric is queried alone and NULL when it is queried with other metrics. Omni keeps the group: 0 for `count`, `count_distinct`, and `sum`, NULL for the other aggregates. Report both differences. This worked example filters an order-items average by the joined users view.

```yaml
# Omni
measures:
  sale_price_average_california:
    aggregate_type: average
    sql: ${omni_dbt_ecomm__order_items.sale_price}
    filters:
      omni_dbt_ecomm__users.state:
        is: California
```

```yaml
# sem_order_items.yml
measures:
  - name: average_sale_price
    agg: average
    expr: sale_price

# metrics_omni_order_items.yml
metrics:
  - name: sale_price_average_california
    label: Sale Price Average (California)
    type: simple
    type_params:
      measure:
        name: average_sale_price
        filter: |
          {{ Dimension('user_id__state') }} = 'California'
```

Queried alone by region, a region with no California users is absent; queried with an unfiltered count, it is NULL.

### Re-import result

When no extension field with the same name exists, Omni imports a filtered simple metric as a hidden `_filter_<metric>` dimension and a measure with `filters: {_filter_<metric>: true}`. The block below is the observed result for a same-view predicate (`status = 'Complete'`) on a live instance; a cross-view predicate gives the same shape with the joined view's field in the `_filter_` dimension `sql`.

```yaml
dimensions:
  _filter_sale_price_average:
    # Produced by the dbt semantic layer integration
    sql: ${omni_dbt_ecomm__order_items.status} = 'Complete'
    description: Intermediate filter dimension for measure sale_price_average
    hidden: true

measures:
  sale_price_average:
    # Measure is defined by the 'sale_price_average' dbt metric (models/semantic-models/metrics_omni_order_items.yml)
    sql: ${omni_dbt_ecomm__order_items.sale_price} * 0.95
    aggregate_type: average
    filters: {_filter_sale_price_average: true}
```

If the Omni model layer already has a field with the exported name, its keys win on re-import; only the provenance comment and dbt-only keys come through. An existing extension can mask individual keys in the returned measure. A field marked `ignored: true` in the extension does not appear in combined output.

## Filter Operators

| Omni operator | MetricFlow form |
|---|---|
| `is: value` | `{{ Dimension('entity__dim') }} = 'value'` |
| `is: [a, b]` | `{{ Dimension('entity__dim') }} IN ('a', 'b')` |
| `not: value` / `not: [a, b]` | `<> 'value'` / `NOT IN ('a', 'b')` |
| `is: true` / `is: false` / `is: null` | `IS TRUE` / `IS FALSE` / `IS NULL` |
| `not: null` | `IS NOT NULL` |
| `falsey: true` | `(x IS FALSE OR x IS NULL)` |
| `greater_than`, `greater_than_or_equal_to`, `less_than`, `less_than_or_equal_to` | `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=` |
| `between: [a, b]` | `BETWEEN a AND b` |
| `contains: x` / `not_contains: x` | `LIKE '%x%'` / `NOT LIKE '%x%'` |
| `starts_with: x` / `not_starts_with: x` / `ends_with: x` | `LIKE 'x%'` / `NOT LIKE 'x%'` / `LIKE '%x'` |
| `case_insensitive: true` modifier | use `ILIKE` (or `LOWER()` on both sides) |
| `and: [...]` / `or: [...]` | `( ... AND ... )` / `( ... OR ... )` |
| `before`, `on_or_after`, `between_dates` with literal dates | `{{ TimeDimension('entity__dim', 'day') }} < '<date>'`, `>= '<date>'`, `BETWEEN '<a>' AND '<b>'` |

Use the entity of the filtered view. Do not use a semantic-model name.

```yaml
# Wrong
filter: "{{ Dimension('sem_users__state') }} = 'California'"

# Right for the order-items → users relationship
filter: "{{ Dimension('user_id__state') }} = 'California'"
```

```yaml
filter: |
  {{ Dimension('order_item_id__status') }} IN ('Complete', 'Shipped')
  AND {{ Dimension('order_item_id__is_returned') }} IS TRUE
  AND {{ TimeDimension('order_item_id__created_at', 'day') }} >= '2024-01-01'
```

Quote strings and dates with single quotes. Double embedded single quotes. Do not interpolate fetched Omni text into Jinja.

Skip and report: `time_for_duration` and `date_offset_from_query` (relative dates); `day_of_week`, `day_of_month`, `month_of_year`, `quarter_of_year` and other calendar parts; user-attribute filters; `field_name_in_query` and `field_name_not_in_query` (query-result filters); `cancel_query_filter`.

## Ratio and Derived Metrics

```yaml
# metrics_omni_order_items.yml
metrics:
  - name: price_per_order
    label: Price per Order
    type: ratio
    type_params:
      numerator: total_sale_price
      denominator: order_id_count_distinct
  - name: taxed_amount
    label: Taxed Amount
    type: derived
    type_params:
      expr: total_sale_price * 1.07
      metrics:
        - name: total_sale_price
```

Ratios become `type: ratio`. Arithmetic over measures becomes `type: derived`. Do not give an atomic measure and a user-facing metric different definitions under the same name.

## Topic Extras

```yaml
saved_queries:
  - name: monthly_sales
    query_params:
      metrics: [total_sale_price]
      group_by:
        - "TimeDimension('metric_time', 'month')"
        - "Dimension('user_id__country')"
      where:
        - "{{ Dimension('order_item_id__status') }} NOT IN ('Returned', 'Cancelled')"
```

Map compatible topic defaults and sample queries to saved queries. Drop table calculations, pivots, and unsupported query logic. `group_by` entries are semantic objects in quotes (`TimeDimension`, `Dimension`, `Entity`). The bare form `metric_time__month` is only valid on the `mf query --group-by` flag; in YAML it fails `dbt parse`. Run `mf query --saved-query <name>` after writing.

## Unsupported Constructs

Skip and report these constructs:

- cross-view dimension expressions;
- templated SQL;
- unsupported joins;
- filter-only fields;
- relative time filters;
- time and period comparison logic; and
- dbt objects the importer does not support, including conversion and cumulative metrics.

## Adapt to your project

| Substitute | Use in your project |
|---|---|
| Omni view name | `<schema>__<view>` |
| dbt model name | The model name in `ref('<model>')` |
| Semantic model name | `sem_<model>` or the project convention |
| Entity names | FK column names on the many side |
| Aggregate time dimension | The model's time dimension for `agg_time_dimension` |
| dbt project YAML layout | Legacy or flattened |
| dbt YAML file layout | `models/semantic-models/` or the project's semantic-YAML location |
