# Updating an Existing Dashboard

Edits go through the **v2 draft flow**: read the published state, author a merge-by-key patch, apply it to a draft, validate the draft, publish. The published dashboard is untouched until `v2-publish-draft` — a bad draft is discarded with zero impact.

> **Advanced layout only.** Classic-layout dashboards return **422** from the v2 endpoints: *"This document uses the classic dashboard layout, which the documents API does not support. Upgrade the dashboard to the advanced layout before editing it through the API."* To fix it, run `omni documents upgrade-layout <identifier>`, then retry. On a published dashboard it publishes the new layout immediately, so confirm with the user first; if a draft exists it returns 409, and `clearExistingDraft: true` discards that draft, so never pass it without asking.

## The five-step loop

**Step 1 — Read** the current state:

```bash
omni documents v2-get <identifier> > doc.json
```

Returns the envelope: `name`, `description`, `modelId` (the shared model), `workbookModelId` (read-only), `queryPresentations {data, order}`, `controls {data, order}`, `containers`, `settings`. There is no `identifier` in the body — keep the one you queried with. `v2-get` returns the **published** state only; if a draft already exists and you want to build on it, read it with `v2-get-draft <identifier> <draftIdentifier>` (ids from `omni documents list-drafts`).

**Step 2 — Author the patch.** Patches **merge by key** (semantics below) — send only what you're changing. Include a `summary` string in the body; it is written to the document's history audit trail.

**Step 3 — Create the draft and apply it**:

```bash
omni documents v2-patch-draft <identifier> --body - < patch.json
# → {identifier, name, description, draftIdentifier}
```

Capture `draftIdentifier` from the response.

**Step 4 — Validate the draft** before anything goes live (see [validation-and-testing.md](validation-and-testing.md)):

```bash
omni documents v2-get-draft <identifier> <draftIdentifier>          # identifier first, then draft id
```

Check tile counts (`queryPresentations.order` vs `data` keys), viz specs, and run the affected queries. Iterate with:

```bash
omni documents v2-patch-draft-by-identifier <identifier> <draftIdentifier> --body '…'   # identifier first, then draft id
```

**Step 5 — Publish**:

```bash
omni documents v2-publish-draft <identifier>
```

Publishes the **main** draft only. Publishing switches the document to the draft's workbook model, so the workbook model id changes. `v2-get` returns the **published** document's workbook model; each new draft has its own copy, returned by `list-drafts` and by that draft's `v2-get-draft`. Read the id of the model you are about to write to.

## Merge-by-key semantics

- `queryPresentations.data` and `controls.data` merge **by key**: keys you send are written, keys you omit are preserved, a key set to `null` is deleted.
- The `order` arrays are **full replacements** — always send the complete ordered list.
- `containers` is a **full replacement** of the layout tree — send the whole tree with your edit applied. Omit it to keep the layout and let the server auto-place any tiles you add.
- `settings` is shallow-merged — send only the keys you're changing.
- A single patch's `queryPresentations` is capped at **48 entries** — split larger edits across multiple patches to the same draft.

## Recipes

All go in a patch body, alongside a `summary`: `v2-patch-draft` for the first patch, which opens the draft, and `v2-patch-draft-by-identifier` for every later patch to that same draft.

**Add a tile** — new key in `data`, append to `order`. Omit `containers` to have the tile auto-placed on the first page, or send the full tree to place it yourself:

```json
{
  "summary": "add revenue KPI",
  "queryPresentations": {
    "data": { "5": { /* full tile — see queryPresentations.md */ } },
    "order": ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"]
  },
  "containers": [ /* optional: existing tree + a stack referencing tile 5 — see containers.md */ ]
}
```

**Edit a tile** — send only that key, with the **complete tile** (a tile read from `v2-get-draft` can be edited and sent back as is):

```json
{
  "summary": "switch trend tile to area",
  "queryPresentations": { "data": { "2": {
    "name": "Revenue Trend", "type": "query", "topicName": "order_items",
    "prefersChart": true, "automaticVis": false,
    "query": { /* full query incl. every collection field — see below */ },
    "visConfig": { "chartType": "area", "fields": ["…"], "version": 0,
      "visConfig": { "visType": "basic", "config": { /* spec */ } } }
  } } }
}
```

**Delete a tile** — set its key to `null`, remove it from `order`, remove its stack from `containers`:

```json
{
  "summary": "remove tile 2",
  "queryPresentations": { "data": { "2": null }, "order": ["1", "3"] },
  "containers": [ /* full tree without tile 2's stack */ ]
}
```

**Rename a tab** — a tab is a tile; its label is the tile's `name`. Send the complete tile with the new `name`; the tile you read back is already in the shape you write.

**Reorder tabs** — send the full `order` array; it replaces wholesale: `{"queryPresentations": {"order": ["3", "1", "2"]}}`. Verify by readback.

**Patch one control** — `{"controls": {"data": {"date_filter": {"config": {…}, "map": {…}}}}}` — merges by key like tiles; include `order` only when adding/removing controls.

**Patch one setting** — `{"settings": {"refreshInterval": 300}}` — shallow merge; other settings untouched.

**Metadata-only edits** — shorthand flags work *when there is no `--body`*:

```bash
omni documents v2-patch-draft <identifier> --name "New Name" --summary "rename"
```

## The `--body` vs flags gotcha

When `--body` is present, the CLI **silently ignores every shorthand flag** (`--name`, `--summary`, `--branch-id`, …) — verified in the CLI source (the body short-circuits before flag assembly) and live. With `--body`, put everything in the JSON. Flags-only (no `--body`) works for metadata edits.

## Errors

| Status | Trigger | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | Unrecognized top-level key | clean per-key message, e.g. `"Unrecognized key: filterConfig"` |
| 400 | Tile query missing collection fields | per-field errors; `sorts`, `filters`, `calculations`, `column_totals`, `row_totals`, `fill_fields`, `pivots`, `userEditedSQL` are required (empty values fine) alongside `table` and `fields` — and always send `limit` and `join_paths_from_topic_name` too |
| 400 | `hidden` on a filter/control config | "controls.data[…].config carries `hidden` … not supported" — remove the key; place or unplace the control through `containers` |
| 404 | Nonexistent document | |
| 404 | `v2-publish-draft` with no **main** draft | `"Document draft does not exist"` — including when only a *branch-bound* draft exists ([branch-bound-drafts.md](branch-bound-drafts.md)) |
| 404 | Patching a draft identifier as if it were published | plain not-found |
| 422 | Classic dashboard layout | exact message above; after the user confirms, `omni documents upgrade-layout <identifier>` (see above), then retry |

## Failure handling

Edits live on a draft, so rollback is trivial — the published document is never touched:

```bash
omni documents discard-draft <identifier>     # targets the MAIN draft
```

- If a patch fails validation, make **one corrected retry at most**, then discard the draft and report the exact error and what was preserved (everything — the published doc is unchanged).
- Do not probe with repeated filter syntaxes, and do not fall back to `omni unstable documents-import` — import creates a *new* document.
- Broken query-level filters: validate the unfiltered base query once; if a dashboard-level control can satisfy the request, use that instead and verify by readback; never persist a filter that fails `omni query run` parsing.
