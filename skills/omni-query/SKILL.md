description: Run queries against Omni Analytics' semantic layer using the Omni CLI, interpret results, and chain queries for multi-step analysis. Use this skill whenever someone wants to query data through Omni, run a report, get metrics, pull numbers, analyze data, ask "how many" / "what's the trend" / "show me the data", retrieve dashboard query results, extract data from an existing dashboard, or inspect the query definition behind a tile. Also use for table calculations and computed columns (running totals, percent-of-total, month-over-month / period-over-period change, moving averages, rankings), open-ended multi-step analysis via agentic AI jobs, and running raw SQL through the semantic layer — even when the user doesn't say "query" (e.g. "add a running total column", "what's our MoM growth", "analyze revenue trends"). For building or editing a dashboard or chart use omni-content-builder; for adding a field or measure to the model use omni-model-builder — this skill retrieves and computes over data.

# Omni Query

Run queries against Omni's semantic layer via the Omni CLI. Omni translates field selections into optimized SQL — you specify what you want (dimensions, measures, filters), not how to get it.

> **Tip**: Use `omni-model-explorer` first if you don't know the available topics and fields.

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Verify the Omni CLI is installed — if not, ask the user to install it
# See: https://github.com/exploreomni/cli#readme
command -v omni >/dev/null || echo "ERROR: Omni CLI is not installed."
```

```bash
# Show available profiles and select the appropriate one
omni config show
# If multiple profiles exist, ask the user which to use, then switch:
omni config use <profile-name>

# Confirm the active profile is authenticated and inspect your permissions:
omni whoami whoami
```

> **Auth**: a profile authenticates with an **API key** or **OAuth**. If `whoami` (or any call) returns **401**, hand off — ask the user to run `! omni config login <profile>` (OAuth 2.1 browser flow; it blocks ~2 min on the browser). Don't run `config login` yourself in a headless/CI session (no browser → timeout); on a local interactive machine you *may*. See the [**`omni-api-conventions`**](../../rules/omni-api-conventions.mdc) rule for profile setup (`omni config init --auth oauth`) and discovering command and request-body shapes with `--schema`.

You also need a **model ID** and knowledge of available **topics and fields**.

## Discovering Commands

```bash
omni query --help              # List query operations
omni query run --help          # Show flags for running a query
omni query run --schema        # Body schema + example — but the query object renders free-form; for its shape use the examples below
omni ai --help                 # AI-powered query generation
```

> **Tip**: Use `-o json` to force structured output for programmatic parsing, or `-o human` for readable tables. The default is `auto` (human in a TTY, JSON when piped).

## Known Issues & Safe Defaults

- **When handed SQL, default to reproducing its intent on a topic** — read what the SQL does (grain, measures, filters, joins), then check whether a topic can express it (`omni-model-explorer`; `omni ai pick-topic` / `omni ai generate-query --run-query=false`). Reach for raw `userEditedSQL` only when no topic fits, or when the user explicitly asks to run their SQL as-is. See *Running Raw SQL*. Don't passthrough SQL by reflex (you're not a text-to-SQL generator), and don't force-fit a topic that doesn't match.
- When the user asks for a **calculated column**, **table calculation**, **running total**, **moving average**, **percent change**, **row total**, **tier label**, **VLOOKUP**, **SUMIF**, or **date difference**, satisfy it with a `calculations[]` table calc selected in `query.fields`. Do not substitute an existing model field, `userEditedSQL`, client-side math, or a narrative-only explanation unless the user explicitly asks for that alternative.
- **Keep table-calc answers auditable.** Don't call the task complete until the final answer names the calc column and shows that same `calc_name` in **both** `query.fields` and `calculations[]` (true even for simple operators like `OMNI_RUNNING_TOTAL`). Include a compact query-JSON excerpt — `query.fields`, the real `calculations[]` object with operators/operands intact, relevant `pivots[]`/`limit`, and the validation result — not a paraphrase like `{ "OMNI_OFFSET_MULTI over": "field" }` or "computed via `OMNI_RUNNING_TOTAL`." Long CSV can bury the query shape; show a few rows plus the reusable shape, or say you're omitting the full JSON for brevity.
- If a calc query succeeds but the calc column is blank, treat it as a failed calc until proven otherwise. Re-check operand order, `for_calc`, date truncation, `outside_pivot`, and whether the `calc_name` appears in `query.fields`.
- **Don't swallow calc errors while authoring or validating.** Keep `swallow_errors: false` (the default) so a bad calc fails loudly with the real message. With `swallow_errors: true`, the column silently shows `#ERROR!` and the query still returns `COMPLETE` — easy to misread as data, a blank calc, or an engine bug. If you see `#ERROR!`, re-run with `swallow_errors: false` to surface the cause (often a referenced field missing from `query.fields`). When re-running a calc query you pulled from a document, dashboard tile, or `omni ai` job, run it **verbatim** — dropping a field the calc references manufactures an error that isn't the calc's fault. Reserve `swallow_errors: true` for a finalized tile that needs per-cell resilience, and validate it with `false` first. See `references/table-calculations.md` §5.11 & §6.5.
- Prefer the documented Omni calc operators over lower-level raw SQL/window ASTs when a template exists. For example, use `Omni.OMNI_RUNNING_TOTAL`, `Omni.OMNI_PERCENT_CHANGE_FROM_PREVIOUS`, and `Omni.OMNI_FX_AVERAGE(Omni.OMNI_OFFSET_MULTI(...))` for moving averages instead of hand-authored `window_call`/`LAG` when the prompt asks for a table calculation.
- **`query run` requires `modelId` INSIDE the `query` object — every time.** A standalone body is `{"query":{"modelId":"<uuid>", …}}`; omit it and the call **400s** with `query.modelId: Invalid input: expected string, received undefined`. This is the **exact opposite** of a v2 **dashboard tile** query (`omni-content-builder`), whose tile query must **never** carry `modelId` (the server anchors tiles to the document's workbook model). Don't let the tile rule bleed into standalone queries — **tiles omit `modelId`; `query run` requires it.** When running against a **branch** or a **workbook/draft model**, set `modelId` to *that* model's id (the branch model id or the draft's `workbookModelId`), not the shared model — and pass `branchId` at the top level only when the skill explicitly calls for it (a branch's own model id already resolves branch fields).
- **To read result rows, set `resultType:"json"` (or `"csv"`) at the body's TOP LEVEL — not inside `query`.** Misplacing it inside `query` is **silently ignored**: you get the default base64-Arrow streaming envelope back (unreadable rows) and waste a round trip. See *Handling and Validating Results*.

## Build queries on a topic

Prefer building every query **on a topic**, not a bare base view. Topics carry the governed joins, labels, and access — and **a query not built on a topic is not accessible to restricted queriers/viewers** (it works for you as a modeler/admin but silently fails for restricted roles). Set the query `table` to the topic's base view and pass `join_paths_from_topic_name: <topic>`. **And if *you* are a Restricted Querier** (`QUERY_TOPICS`, no `QUERY_FULL_MODEL` — check `whoami`), topic-based isn't just preferred, it's the **only** option: a bare base-view query or a raw-SQL `userEditedSQL` query needs `QUERY_FULL_MODEL`, so **every query you author and place into content must be topic-based.**

**How the join map resolves joined-view fields.** `table` stays the topic's **base view**; `join_paths_from_topic_name` lets the topic's join map reach *joined*-view fields from it — e.g. to select `users.state` on an `order_items`-based topic, `table` stays `order_items` and the join comes from the topic; you do **not** set `table: users`. Omit `join_paths_from_topic_name` (or point `table` at a non-base view) and joined-view fields may fail to resolve or join wrong. Confirm the base view and every reachable join with `omni models get-topic <modelId> <topic>` — its `base_view_name` and `join_via_map` show the base view and the join path to each reachable view. (This is the canonical topic-query shape; `omni-content-builder` tiles and `omni-model-builder` validation queries use it too.)

**Decide where the query should come from:**
1. **An existing topic answers it** (its base view + a join-reachable view) → query that topic.
2. **The field is on a join-reachable view but the topic doesn't expose it / lacks the join** → propose *extending* the topic (add the relationship/join), then build it via `omni-model-builder`.
3. **Fundamentally different subject, constraints, or audience** → propose a *new* topic (see the "new topic vs extend" criteria in `omni-model-builder`). Prompt the requestor first, and build it on a branch.

**Fallback — non-topic query pathways.** Two pathways run *outside* any topic: a **bare base view** (`table:` + the global `relationships` file for joins) and **raw SQL** (`userEditedSQL`, see "Running Raw SQL"). Both share the same caveat: topic-scoped controls — **access filters** (row-level) and **always_where** — are not applied, and in a dashboard the tile is **invisible to Viewer / Restricted Querier roles by default** (handling a restricted audience is a content-permission concern — see **`omni-content-builder`**). The two pathways differ on **object-level access grants**: a bare-view query still enforces them, but raw SQL bypasses them too (it's the most permissive pathway). Prefer a topic when one fits; reach for a non-topic pathway only when nothing else expresses the query.

When the conclusion is "build or modify a topic," hand off to **`omni-model-builder`** to do it right.

**Composite topics.** A composite (`is_composite: true` in `list-topics`) has no base view: send `join_paths_from_topic_name: <composite>` and **no `table`**. Address fields as `@_shared_dimensions_.<name>[timeframe]`, `@_shared_views_.<view>.<field>`, and `@<topic>.<view>.<measure>`; a filter keyed `@<topic>.` applies to that member topic only; the `@` is required. A dimension that belongs to one member topic can be filtered but not selected under the composite's default `unrelated_dimension_handling` — make it a shared dimension if it must be grouped on, or expect the composite to declare `null_fill` (other members' measures land on a null row) or `repeat` (they repeat on every row). `get-topic` on the composite lists the addressable surface.

## Running a Query

### Basic Query

```bash
omni query run --body '{
  "query": {
    "modelId": "your-model-id",
    "table": "order_items",
    "fields": [
      "order_items.created_at[month]",
      "order_items.total_revenue"
    ],
    "limit": 100,
    "join_paths_from_topic_name": "order_items"
  }
}'
```

### Query Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `modelId` | **Yes — inside `query`** | UUID of the Omni model (or branch/workbook model id). **Required on every standalone `query run`**; omitting it 400s. Contrast: v2 dashboard **tile** queries omit it entirely. |
| `table` | Conditional | Base view (the `FROM`). Required for a semantic query **unless** `join_paths_from_topic_name` is set (base view comes from the topic) or `userEditedSQL` is used (table ignored). |
| `fields` | Yes | Array of `view.field_name` references |
| `join_paths_from_topic_name` | Recommended | Topic for join resolution |
| `limit` | No | Row limit (default 1000, max 50000, `null` for unlimited) |
| `sorts` | No | Array of sort objects |
| `filters` | No | Filter object |
| `pivots` | No | Array of field names to pivot on |

### Field Naming

Fields use `view_name.field_name`. Date fields support timeframe brackets:

```
users.created_at[date]      — Daily
users.created_at[week]      — Weekly
users.created_at[month]     — Monthly
users.created_at[quarter]   — Quarterly
users.created_at[year]      — Yearly
```

### Sorts

```json
"sorts": [
  { "column_name": "order_items.total_revenue", "sort_descending": true }
]
```

### Filters

`query.filters` is a map of **`fieldName` → a typed filter object** — the shape Omni's UI emits (verified against a live dashboard's `filterConfig` and end-to-end via `query run`):

```json
"filters": {
  "users.state":            { "type": "string", "kind": "EQUALS",       "values": ["California", "New York"] },
  "products.category":      { "type": "string", "kind": "CONTAINS",      "values": ["Jeans"] },
  "order_items.sale_price": { "type": "number", "kind": "GREATER_THAN",  "values": [100] },
  "order_items.created_at": { "type": "date",   "kind": "BEFORE",        "values": ["2024-01-01"] },
  "order_items.shipped_at": { "type": "date",   "kind": "TIME_FOR_INTERVAL_DURATION", "ui_type": "PAST", "left_side": "12 months ago", "right_side": "12 months" },
  "order_items.is_shipped": { "type": "boolean", "is_negative": false }
}
```

- **`type`** — `string` / `number` / `date` / `boolean`. **Boolean filters use `is_negative`** (`false` = is true, `true` = is false), *not* `kind`/`values` (+ optional `treat_nulls_as_false`).
- **`kind`** (operator, for string/number/date) — string: `EQUALS`, `CONTAINS`, `STARTS_WITH`, `ENDS_WITH`, `IS_EMPTY`, `SQL_LIKE`; number: `EQUALS`, `GREATER_THAN`, `LESS_THAN`, `BETWEEN`; date: `BEFORE`, `ON_OR_AFTER`, `BETWEEN`, `TIME_FOR_INTERVAL_DURATION`/`TIME_FOR_UNIT_DURATION` (rolling windows), `IS_ON_DAY_OF_WEEK`, … (`QUERY_OFFSET` references another query).
- **`values`** — array of operands: a single value, a list (multi-select `EQUALS`), or `[lo, hi]` for `BETWEEN`. Date **rolling windows** use `left_side`/`right_side` + `ui_type` (e.g. `PAST`) instead of `values`.
- **Verify the filter actually bound.** A filter object with the wrong properties for its type (e.g. `kind`/`values` on a `boolean`, which needs `is_negative`) is **silently ignored** — the query returns `COMPLETE` but the filter never reaches the SQL. Confirm via `cache:"SkipCache"` → `summary.display_sql` (the `WHERE`), or that the row count actually changes. The exact `kind`/`ui_type`/boolean enums live in `omni documents v2-create --schema` (under the filter objects); see also [references/filter-expressions.md](references/filter-expressions.md).

> **Do NOT use the bare-string shorthand** (`"order_items.status": "complete"`, `"last 90 days"`, `"not null"`). The query API rejects it — `400 "Unable to parse data stream"` as of August 2026, `500 "Cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'query_id' in <value>"` on older builds. The typed object above is the reliable form. *(Reproduced on current Omni for value, date, null-string, number, and boolean forms.)*

### Pivots

```json
{
  "query": {
    "fields": ["order_items.created_at[month]", "order_items.status", "order_items.count"],
    "pivots": ["order_items.status"],
    "join_paths_from_topic_name": "order_items"
  }
}
```

**Pivoted queries reject `limit: null`** — pass an explicit numeric limit (e.g., `5000`). Unlimited is only allowed when `pivots[]` is empty.

### Transpose measures into rows (`transposed_measures`)

Folds several **measures** from one wide row into **long form** — one row per measure — so the measures become a category you can chart against (e.g. a funnel, or a "measures on the axis" bar). `transposed_measures` is an **array of the measure field names** to fold (the same names you put in `fields`), **not a boolean** — passing `true` is silently rejected (`z.array(z.string())`), yielding an empty result.

```json
{
  "query": {
    "table": "order_items",
    "fields": ["order_items.units_sold", "order_items.shipped_items", "order_items.delivered_items"],
    "transposed_measures": ["order_items.units_sold", "order_items.shipped_items", "order_items.delivered_items"],
    "join_paths_from_topic_name": "order_items"
  }
}
```

The result gains three synthetic columns at the first transposed measure's position:
- **`measure_name`** — the measure's field name; **renders as the measure's friendly label** in a viz (e.g. "Units Sold").
- **`measure_order`** — `0, 1, 2, …` in the order listed (the stage order).
- **`measure_value`** — that measure's value for the row.

This is the supported way to build a **funnel from multiple measures** (Omni's funnel needs a stage *dimension* + one measure, not N measures): chart `measure_name` as the stage and `measure_value` as the value. See `omni-content-builder` → *Config Object: Funnel*.

### Table Calculations

Post-query computed columns (running totals, % of total, ratios, conditionals). Authored as AST objects in `calculations[]`. The query API requires the parsed AST — it does **not** accept the workbook-frontend `{name, formula}` shape.

Minimum calc — one `calculations[]` entry (its `calc_name` must also be in `query.fields`):

```json
{ "calc_name": "calc_pct", "label": "% of Total", "format": "0.0%",
  "sql_expression": { "type": "call", "operator": "Omni.OMNI_PERCENT_OF_TOTAL",
    "operands": [{ "type": "field", "field_name": "orders.total_revenue", "for_calc": true }] } }
```

**The #1 gotcha:** `calc_name` must also appear in `query.fields` (and the outer `queryPresentation.fields` for dashboard tiles). A calc defined in `calculations[]` but absent from `fields` is computed but never rendered.

The five quick-template operators (each takes one `field` operand with `for_calc: true`):
`Omni.OMNI_PERCENT_OF_TOTAL`, `Omni.OMNI_PERCENT_OF_PREVIOUS`, `Omni.OMNI_PERCENT_CHANGE_FROM_PREVIOUS`, `Omni.OMNI_RUNNING_TOTAL`, `Omni.OMNI_RANK`.

Use `omni query run` with a hand-authored or copied AST when you already know the calc shape. **To *generate* anything non-trivial — table calculations, period-over-period, multi-step analysis — prefer the agentic path (`omni ai job-submit`):** it authors calcs that `generate-query` silently drops (e.g. month-over-month % change). To get a *reusable* AST out of an agentic job, lift the structured query / `calculations` from the job's **`actions[].generate_query`** result (not the `resultSummary`, and not a `userEditedSQL`/SQL fallback), then **re-run *your assembled* query** with `swallow_errors:false` and **diff the values against the job's `csvResult`**. The job already executed the calc, so the re-run isn't re-proving the math — it's checking your *reshape* (a dropped/renamed field is the kind of translation failure that "it ran and returned rows" would miss; see [table-calculations.md](references/table-calculations.md) §6). Reserve `generate-query` for simple deterministic single queries, and for shape-only drafting where query execution isn't permitted.

Query tasks are read-only unless the user explicitly asks to change the model. If a field appears missing, inspect topics/dashboard queries and use the right model/topic/branch or report the missing-field blocker — don't create branches, add measures, or edit YAML just to make a query work. (And don't satisfy a calc request with client-side math or an existing model field like `users.tier_label` — build and validate the table calc; see *Known Issues*.)

Common requests → operator (exact AST + per-recipe gotchas in the reference — don't hand-improvise):
- **% of total** → `OMNI_PERCENT_OF_TOTAL` · **running total** → `OMNI_RUNNING_TOTAL` (sort time **ascending**, don't reverse outside Omni) · **MoM % change** → `OMNI_PERCENT_CHANGE_FROM_PREVIOUS` (not `omni_period_pivot`/`LAG`) · **trailing N-avg** → `OMNI_FX_AVERAGE` over `OMNI_OFFSET_MULTI`
- **pivot row-total** → `OMNI_FX_SUM` + `OMNI_PIVOT_OFFSET` (`outside_pivot:true`, numeric `limit`) · **tier labels** → `OMNI_FX_IFS` (not `CASE`/a model field) · **SUMIF** → `OMNI_FX_SUM_IF` · **VLOOKUP** → `OMNI_FX_VLOOKUP` (if a string lookup 400s `No referenced query…`, fall back to `OMNI_FX_SUM_IF`) · **date diff** → `OMNI_FX_DATEDIF` (`[date]` operands)

For the exact JSON AST per recipe, the full operator catalog (`Omni.*` / `SqlStdOperatorTable.*`), node types, validation rules, and the unfamiliar-calc round-trip strategy, see **[references/table-calculations.md](references/table-calculations.md)** — SKILL.md is the workflow guardrail; the reference holds the detailed shapes.

At execution, calcs compile into an outer `SELECT` wrapping the base aggregation; window-style operators emit `... OVER (...)` there, so the shared data model never needs window functions to support them. In pivoted queries, template operators auto-partition by the pivot column for per-segment series; set `outside_pivot: true` and wrap an aggregator around `OMNI_PIVOT_OFFSET` for a row-summary that sweeps across pivot columns.

## Running Raw SQL (`userEditedSQL`)

> **Given SQL? Reproduce it through a topic first** (see *Known Issues*). Express the SQL's intent through the semantic layer; reach for raw `userEditedSQL` only when no topic can express it (SQL-first migration, warehouse-specific SQL, one-off ad-hoc read) or the user asks to run it as-is. If a faithful reproduction would need a field/topic that doesn't exist but *should*, propose modeling it (`omni-model-builder`) rather than defaulting to raw SQL.
>
> **Reading `generate-query` output:** when the topic lacks a measure the metric needs, `generate-query` returns a **`${}`-templated `userEditedSQL`** (e.g. `SUM(${view.sale_price}) AS sale_price_sum FROM ${Topic}`) and lists its SQL-output aliases (like `sale_price_sum`) in `fields`. Those aliases are **not model fields** — don't strip the SQL and try to run them semantically (they won't resolve). And the `${Topic}` token resolves **only inside `generate-query`'s own execution** — the templated query is **not** directly runnable via `query run` or persistable as a dashboard tile (it errors with `No such view "Order Items"`). So don't reuse it as-is; treat it as a **signal that the topic is missing a measure** and add that measure (`omni-model-builder`) so the metric becomes a clean semantic field.

`userEditedSQL` is a **non-topic query pathway** — the same family as a bare-view query (see "Fallback — non-topic query pathways"). It's an escape hatch for SQL the semantic layer can't express; prefer a topic or semantic fields when they fit.

```bash
omni query run --body '{
  "query": {
    "modelId": "<model-id>",
    "fields": [],
    "userEditedSQL": "select count(*) as cnt from ECOMM.ORDER_ITEMS"
  }
}'
```

- **`fields` must be present** (an array; may be empty `[]`); `table` is not needed. The SQL is authoritative — populated `fields`/`table` are ignored when `userEditedSQL` is set.
- Runs against the model's **connection** — write warehouse-dialect SQL with fully-qualified names, not field references.
- **`"rewriteSql": false`** runs your SQL verbatim (the default parses and re-emits it — re-quoting identifiers, aliasing projections into the `view.field` namespace). **`"dbtMode": true`** allows Jinja/dbt templating. (Both are camelCase; the `query` object is permissive, so a misspelled/snake_case key is silently dropped.)
- **Permission-gated:** the querier's role must permit manually-written SQL. Without it the job fails — `error_type: "FORBIDDEN"`, *"queries based on manually written SQL are restricted"* — returned as **HTTP 200 with the error in the job body**, not a 4xx.
- **Access behavior:** raw SQL bypasses **all** model controls — object-level **access grants**, row-level **access filters**, and **always_where** — and is invisible to Viewer/Restricted Querier roles in a dashboard. It's the most permissive pathway; use only for ad-hoc reads by privileged users, and **strip it from any reused/dashboard query** (see "Using Job Results in a Dashboard").
- **Row cap:** an unbounded raw query is capped at **50,000 rows** (the response returns 50,001 — the cap plus one truncation sentinel). The envelope `limit` is **not** applied to raw SQL; put `LIMIT` in the SQL itself to bound results.

## Request-level options (outside `query`)

These keys sit at the **top level** of the body, beside `query`, not inside it. **The `query` object is permissive — a key you misplace inside `query` (e.g. `resultType`, `branchId`, `cache`) is silently dropped, not rejected**, so the call "succeeds" while ignoring your option. The tell-tale for a misplaced `resultType` is getting the base64-Arrow envelope back when you asked for JSON/CSV.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `resultType` | Output format: `csv`, `xlsx`, or `json`. **Top-level only** — inside `query` it's silently ignored and you get Arrow. Omit for the default base64 Arrow response. |
| `cache` | Cache policy: `Standard` (default), `SkipRequery`, `SkipCache`, `SkipCacheAndRebuildExtracts` (also rebuilds the extracts the query reads from). |
| `userId` | Run as another user (org-scoped API keys); also the `--user-id` flag. |
| `branchId` | Run against a model **branch** (validate draft model changes on live data). Must be a branch of the same shared model. |
| `planOnly` | Return the execution plan **without running** the query (validate/debug at no warehouse cost). Cannot combine with `resultType`. |
| `formatResults` | On exports, emit **formatted** values (e.g. `$1,234.56`) vs. raw. Requires `resultType`; ignored for Arrow. |
| `timezone` | Per-request timezone override (IANA id). Requires the connection setting `allowsUserSpecificTimezones` **and** the org setting `allowsDocumentCanUseTimezoneOverride`; silently no-ops if either is off. |
| `workbookUrl` | Also create an ephemeral workbook for the query, so the user gets an "open in Omni" link. On CLI ≥ 1.3.0 pass `--workbook` instead of setting it by hand. The link comes back in a response **header**, not the body: the CLI prints it under human output, or as `{"workbookUrl": …}` on **stderr** in JSON mode. If the (target) user lacks the workbooks permission on the model, the query still succeeds and the link is **silently omitted** — no link means no permission, not a failure to retry. |

### Confirming an aggregate table was used

When the model declares aggregate tables (`materialized_query`), plan the query with `planOnly: true` and `cache: SkipCache` and read `summary.display_sql`. A query served from an aggregate table is headed `-- Query rewritten to use materialized view "<view>"` with the original SQL commented out beneath; no header means the fact table was used. On a composite topic each member query is matched separately and the header names the first table used, so read the SQL for the other members. Why a query misses is covered in `omni-model-builder`'s aggregate-awareness reference.

### Showing results to a person (CLI ≥ 1.3.0)

In human mode `query run` renders a formatted table using the model's labels and number formats, and polls unfinished jobs itself. `--chart` draws the same result as a terminal bar table (`--chart-value` picks measures, `--chart-rows` caps rows); it still draws when piped, at 80 columns, so it fits a chat code block. `--chart` drops a `resultType` from the body and is refused with `-o json`. Neither view carries the job envelope — **validate with a JSON-mode run** (below), then render for the user.

## Handling and Validating Results

> **`omni query run` streams NDJSON — it is NOT one JSON object.** In JSON mode (pass `-o json` when parsing — a human default from `config set-format` or `OMNI_OUTPUT_FORMAT` applies even when piped, and prints a table instead) the CLI prints **multiple JSON objects, one per line**: first a `{"jobs_submitted":{…}}` line, then one or more `{"job_id":…,"status":"COMPLETE","summary":{…}}` job lines (and, with `resultType`, the result payload). A naive `json.loads(entire_stdout)` throws `JSONDecodeError: Extra data`. **Don't write a single-object parser** — iterate lines and pick the one you need, or slurp with `jq -s` / read the **last** non-empty line. `--compact` puts each object on one tidy line.

Default response: base64-encoded Apache Arrow table. Arrow results are binary — you cannot parse individual row data from the raw response. The row count is at **`cache_metadata.num_rows`** (not `summary.row_count`). The `summary` object holds validation metadata: `invalid_calculations`, `missing_fields`, `display_sql` (the compiled SQL), `omni_sql_parse_failed`. (`--schema` won't show any of this — it describes the request body only; response shape comes from a live response. See the [`omni-api-conventions`](../../rules/omni-api-conventions.mdc) rule.)

**To read rows yourself, always set `resultType: "json"` (or `"csv"`) at the body's TOP LEVEL — then stdout is a clean, directly-parseable JSON array (or CSV), with none of the Arrow/NDJSON envelope to unpack.** This is the single reliable way to spot-check values; reaching for the default Arrow path and trying to decode rows from it is the common time-waster.

```json
{ "query": { ... }, "resultType": "csv" }
```

`resultType: "xlsx"` is also valid, but it returns a **binary** `.xlsx` file (zip-based) — like the default Arrow blob, you can't read it inline without a spreadsheet app or a library. Use it only to **deliver a file** to a person, not to inspect results. For agent-side reading, stick to `csv`/`json`.

### Result Validation

Every query response should be checked before trusting the results or presenting them to the user.

**Check for errors:**
- If the response contains an `error` key, the query failed. Common causes: bad field name, missing join path, malformed filter expression, permission error.
- If the response contains `remaining_job_ids`, the query is still running — poll with `omni query wait` before checking results.

**Check row count** (field is `cache_metadata.num_rows`):
- `cache_metadata.num_rows == 0` — the query returned no data. This may be valid (e.g., no data in the filter range) but is worth flagging to the user. Common causes: overly restrictive filters, wrong date range, field that doesn't match any rows.
- `cache_metadata.num_rows` equals the `limit` you set — results may be truncated. If the user needs complete data, re-run with a higher limit or `null` for unlimited.

**Spot-check data with CSV:**

When accuracy matters, request CSV and scan the output:

```bash
omni query run --body '{
  "query": { ... },
  "resultType": "csv"
}'
```

Check that:
- Column headers match the fields you requested
- Values are in expected ranges (e.g., revenue isn't negative, dates aren't in the future)
- Aggregations make sense (e.g., a count isn't returning a sum)

**Validate filter behavior:**

If your query includes filters, verify they're being applied:

```bash
# Run the same query without filters
omni query run --body '{ "query": { ... (no filters) ... }, "resultType": "csv" }'

# Compare row counts — filtered should be <= unfiltered
```

If both queries return the same row count, the filter may not be binding — check the field name, and that the filter object matches its field type (a `boolean` needs `is_negative`, not `kind`/`values` — a mismatch is silently ignored). Confirm the condition appears in `summary.display_sql` (`cache:"SkipCache"`).

### Validation Checklist

| Check | How | When |
|-------|-----|------|
| No error in response | Check for `error` key | Every query |
| Calcs/fields valid | `summary.invalid_calculations` and `summary.missing_fields` empty | Every query (esp. with calculations) |
| Data was returned | `cache_metadata.num_rows > 0` | Every query |
| Results not truncated | `cache_metadata.num_rows < limit` | When completeness matters |
| Columns are correct | CSV column headers match requested fields | When building dashboards or reports |
| Values are reasonable | Spot-check CSV output | When presenting to users |
| Filters are applied | Compare filtered vs unfiltered row counts | When using filters |
| Long-running query completed | No `remaining_job_ids` in final response | Queries on large tables |

### Decoding Arrow Results

```python
import base64, pyarrow as pa
arrow_bytes = base64.b64decode(response["data"])
reader = pa.ipc.open_stream(arrow_bytes)
df = reader.read_all().to_pandas()
```

### Long-Running Queries

If the response includes `remaining_job_ids`, poll until complete:

```bash
omni query wait --job-ids job-id-1,job-id-2
```

JSON mode never polls for you: the stream ends at the wait window and the footer's `remaining_job_ids` is the only sign the result is incomplete. (Human-mode output on CLI ≥ 1.3.0 does poll.)

## Running Queries from Dashboards

Extract and re-run queries powering existing dashboards:

```bash
# Get all queries from a dashboard
omni documents get-queries <dashboardId>

# Run as a specific user
omni query run --body '{ "query": { ... }, "userId": "user-uuid-here" }'

# Cache policy (valid values: Standard, SkipRequery, SkipCache, SkipCacheAndRebuildExtracts)
omni query run --body '{ "query": { ... }, "cache": "SkipCache" }'
```

## AI-Powered Query Generation

Instead of constructing query JSON manually, you can describe what you want in natural language and let Omni's AI generate the query.

### Generate Query (synchronous)

The fastest path — returns a generated query JSON synchronously. Pass `--run-query false` to get only the query structure without executing it (default runs the query).

```bash
# Just generate the query JSON (no execution)
omni ai generate-query your-model-id "Show me revenue by month" --run-query false
```

Response:

```json
{
  "query": {
    "fields": ["order_items.created_at[month]", "order_items.total_revenue"],
    "table": "order_items",
    "filters": {},
    "sorts": [{"column_name": "order_items.created_at[month]", "sort_descending": false}],
    "limit": 500
  },
  "topic": "order_items",
  "error": null
}
```

```bash
# Generate and execute in one call
omni ai generate-query your-model-id "Top 10 customers by lifetime spend"
```

Optional flags:
- `--branch-id` — test against a specific model branch
- `--current-topic-name` — constrain topic selection to a specific topic

### Pick Topic

Check which topic the AI would select for a question, without generating a full query:

```bash
omni ai pick-topic your-model-id "How many users signed up last month?"
```

### Agentic Queries (async)

For the full Blobby experience — multi-step analysis, tool use, and topic selection as the AI would actually behave in production. This is async: submit a job, poll for status, then retrieve the result.

```bash
# 1. Submit a job
JID=$(omni ai job-submit your-model-id "Analyze revenue trends; identify our fastest growing category" -o json \
  | python3 -c 'import json,sys;print(json.load(sys.stdin)["jobId"])')

# 2. Poll with EARLY EXIT on any terminal state — break on success AND on failure
while :; do
  S=$(omni ai job-status "$JID" -o json | python3 -c 'import json,sys;print((json.load(sys.stdin).get("state") or "").lower())')
  case "$S" in
    complete*)             break ;;                       # done → go fetch the result
    fail*|cancel*|error*)  echo "job $S"; break ;;        # terminal failure → STOP, do not keep sleeping
    *)                     sleep 5 ;;                      # only the non-terminal branch sleeps
  esac
done

# 3. Get the result (resultSummary = narrative; actions[] = structured output)
omni ai job-result "$JID" -o json
```

> **Poll loops must early-exit on every terminal state — never a fixed-count `for … sleep … done` that only breaks on success.** If the success filter is wrong (`status` vs `state`, `COMPLETE` vs `COMPLETED`) or the job errors, such a loop runs to the end. Use the `while :; … case … break` form above: sleep **only** in the default branch, break the instant the state is terminal (complete\* **or** fail/cancel/error). Read the field tolerantly (`state ?? status`, lowercased; `startswith("complete")` = done) so one loop survives the cross-job spelling differences below.

> **Job-status shape.** Poll **`state`** — `omni ai job-status` has **no `status` field**. States: `QUEUED` → `EXECUTING` → `DELIVERING` → terminal **`COMPLETE`** / `FAILED` / `CANCELLED`. Note it's `COMPLETE`, **not** `COMPLETED` — the model-refresh (`completed`) and `models jobs-get-status` (`COMPLETED`) flows spell it differently, so a poll loop reused across job types needs a **tolerant terminal check**: read the field as `state ?? status`, lowercase it, treat `startswith("complete")` as done and `{failed, cancelled, error}` as failed. The answer text is **`resultSummary`**; structured output is under **`actions[]`** (`type: "generate_query"` → `result.query`).

The result contains an `actions` array with each step the AI took — look for actions with `type: "generate_query"` to extract the generated queries. The response also includes `resultSummary` with the AI's narrative interpretation.

Before presenting an async job answer, inspect the `actions[]` entries. A job can reach `COMPLETE` while an individual `generate_query` action has `status: "pending"` or no `csvResult`; the narrative may then describe a query that was generated but not executed. Each action's `status` says how that step ended — `complete`, `partial` (did some of what was asked and says what is missing), `skipped`, or `failed` — and is separate from `result.status` (`success` / `error`), which only says whether the generated query ran. A `partial` action with `result.status: "success"` still answered less than was asked. If a required action is pending, partial, or failed, do not treat the job summary as final. Run or regenerate that specific query, or continue the same analysis with another async job, then present only validated results.

Additional job commands:
- `omni ai job-cancel <jobId>` — cancel a running job
- `omni ai job-visualization <jobId>` — get the visualization output
- `omni ai job-feedback-submit <jobId> --body '{"rating":"good"}'` — record a thumbs up/down on a finished job (CLI ≥ 1.2.2). `rating` is **required** (`good` / `bad`); `comment` is optional free text. Only once the poll reports `COMPLETE`/`FAILED` — any other state is a 409. Append-only and never read back, so submit once per job. With an org-scoped key, pass `--user-id` to attribute the feedback to the user the job was submitted with.

### Using Job Results in a Dashboard

The query object inside a job result is **not directly usable** as a dashboard `queryPresentation` — it requires a transformation. Key rules:

- **Always strip `userEditedSQL`** — it makes the tile a non-topic query, so it bypasses **all** model controls (object-level access grants, row-level access filters, and `always_where`) and is invisible to restricted roles in a dashboard. The `${Order Items}` topic-name token it contains also fails outside the job execution context.
- **When `calculations[]` is non-empty**, stripping `userEditedSQL` is sufficient — the structured calc renders correctly.
- **When `calculations[]` is empty**, Blobby authored the calc as inline SQL. The parsed AST is available in `csvResultFields` (at `result` level, not inside `result["query"]`) and can be reconstructed as a proper `calculations[]` entry. Fields whose top-level expr operator is an aggregate (`SUM`, `COUNT`, etc.) cannot be reconstructed as table calcs — add them to the model as filtered measures instead.

For the complete transformation algorithm, discriminator logic, field-ref injection, aggregate-skip handling, and sanity-check approach, see [references/job-result-to-presentation.md](references/job-result-to-presentation.md).

### When to Use Which Approach

| Approach | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| `omni query run` | You know exactly which fields, filters, and sorts you need |
| `omni query run` with `calculations[]` | Explicit table-calculation requests where you know or can copy the AST shape |
| `omni ai generate-query --run-query=false` | Drafting a **simple** query AST to inspect/hand-edit; **or shape-only when query execution isn't permitted** (the fallback when you can't run an agentic job) |
| `omni ai generate-query --run-query=true` | Simple dimension/measure queries where you want a synchronous response |
| `omni ai job-submit` | **Anything non-trivial** — multi-step analysis, **or generating a table calc / reusable query AST**. Lift the structured query/`calculations` from `actions[].generate_query`, then validate with `query run` |

**Steer the prompt when you know the shape:** when a table calculation is the desired or known-correct output, say so in the prompt — append "… *as a table calculation*", or name the semantics ("running total" / "% of total" / "moving average") — so the agentic job emits a real calc in `actions[].generate_query` rather than a `userEditedSQL`/SQL fallback. (The agentic-vs-`generate-query` split and the "lift the AST from `actions[].generate_query`, then validate with `query run`" rule are in the table above and under *Table Calculations*.)

## Multi-Step Analysis Pattern

For complex analysis, chain queries:

1. **Broad query** — understand the shape of the data
2. **Inspect results** — identify interesting segments or patterns
3. **Focused follow-ups** — filter based on findings
4. **Synthesize** — combine results into a narrative

## Common Query Patterns

**Time Series**: fields + date dimension + ascending sort + date filter

**Top N**: fields + metric + descending sort + limit

**Aggregation with Breakdown**: multiple dimensions + multiple measures + descending sort by key metric

## Known Bugs

- **Bare-string filter expressions are rejected.** `"filters": { "field": "complete" | "last 90 days" | "not null" }` returns `400 "Unable to parse data stream"` as of August 2026 (older builds returned `500 "Cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'query_id' in <value>"` — the query-reference/`field_name_in_query` probe). **Use the typed filter object** (see *Filters* above). Reproduced for value, date, null-string, number, and boolean forms.

## Linking to Results

Queries are ephemeral — there is no persistent URL for a query result. To give the user a shareable link:

- **For existing dashboards**: `{OMNI_BASE_URL}/dashboards/{identifier}` (the `identifier` comes from the document API response)
- **For new analysis**: Create a document via `omni-content-builder` with the query as a `queryPresentation`, then share `{OMNI_BASE_URL}/dashboards/{identifier}`
