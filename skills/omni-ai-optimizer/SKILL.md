# Omni AI Optimizer

Optimize your Omni semantic model so Blobby (the Omni Agent) returns accurate, contextual answers.

> **Tip**: Use `omni-model-explorer` to inspect current AI context before making changes.

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Verify the Omni CLI is installed — if not, ask the user to install it
# See: https://github.com/exploreomni/cli#readme
command -v omni >/dev/null || echo "ERROR: Omni CLI is not installed."
```

```bash
# Show available profiles and select the appropriate one
omni config show
# If multiple profiles exist, ask the user which to use, then switch:
omni config use <profile-name>

# Confirm the active profile is authenticated and inspect your permissions:
omni whoami whoami
```

> **Auth**: a profile authenticates with an **API key** or **OAuth**. If `whoami` (or any call) returns **401**, hand off — ask the user to run `! omni config login <profile>` (OAuth 2.1 browser flow; it blocks ~2 min on the browser). Don't run `config login` yourself in a headless/CI session (no browser → timeout); on a local interactive machine you *may*. See the [**`omni-api-conventions`**](../../rules/omni-api-conventions.mdc) rule for profile setup (`omni config init --auth oauth`) and discovering command and request-body shapes with `--schema`.

Requires **Modeler** or **Connection Admin** permissions.

## Discovering Commands

```bash
omni models --help                    # List all model operations
omni models yaml-create --help        # Show flags for writing YAML
```

> **Tip**: Use `-o json` to force structured output for programmatic parsing, or `-o human` for readable tables. The default is `auto` (human in a TTY, JSON when piped).

## Safe Model Write Defaults

- **Branch first** — never write AI optimization YAML directly to the shared model unless the user explicitly asks for a production change. Create or use a model branch, then pass the branch id to `omni models yaml-create`.
- **Read before writing** — inspect the current topic/view YAML before adding `ai_context`, `ai_fields`, `sample_queries`, descriptions, or synonyms. If the requested optimization already exists, report that it is already configured instead of duplicating it.
- **Topic requests stay on topics** — when the user asks to improve a topic, prefer topic-level `ai_context`, `ai_fields`, or `sample_queries`. Use field-level `synonyms` only when the request is clearly about alternate names for one specific field.
- **Do not add "supporting" synonyms after a complete topic mapping** — for requests like "Blobby confuses revenue with order count" or "map these terms correctly", if topic-level `ai_context` already maps the business terms to the correct fields and includes the needed negative guardrails, stop and report that no duplicate write is needed. Adding field-level synonyms in that case is redundant and increases prompt/token surface.
- **Create branches with `--name`** — `omni models create-branch <model-id> --name <branch-name>` does not accept a JSON `--body`.

## How Blobby Works

### Context priority order

Omni assembles the context window in this order:

1. **Context and tuning pre-built by Omni Engineering**
2. **`ai_context`** on the model, topics, and views
3. **Topic `description`**
4. **Topic `name` and `base_view`**
5. **Prioritized field properties** — `name` (fully qualified, `view.field`) and field `ai_context`. Never pruned.
6. **Pruned field properties** — everything else, dropped in the order below when space runs short.

`hidden: true` fields are excluded entirely. `ai_chat_topics` (model-level) controls which topics Blobby can see at all.

### Pruning order

When a topic's metadata exceeds its allotment, Omni removes properties **lowest priority first**, clearing each one from *every* field before moving to the next:

`all_values` → `sql` → `sample_values` → `description` → `group_label` → `label` → `aggregate_type` → `data_type` → `synonyms`

Two consequences worth internalizing:

- **`all_values` goes first**, because the AI can fetch a field's values on demand. **`synonyms` go last**, because they do the most work matching user phrasing to fields.
- **`ai_context` is never pruned** when Omni assembles context for a specific topic — at any level (model, topic, view, field). If it still doesn't fit, Omni drops whole views from model search, and past that the **request fails with an error**. Bloated `ai_context` is not a soft cost — it can starve field metadata and break queries outright. The one exception is *topic selection*, where view-level `ai_context` is trimmed first (see the caps table below).

### Context is guidance, not instruction

All context is passed to the LLM together, and the LLM decides how to weight it:

- **Model-level `ai_context` does not reliably override topic-level `ai_context`.** Don't design around precedence that isn't guaranteed.
- Instructions may be followed partially or not at all, especially when complex or self-contradictory.
- **Behavior is non-deterministic** — the same question can pull different context on different runs.

Prefer few, unambiguous, non-conflicting instructions over exhaustive rulebooks. Debug what the AI actually received with the [workbook inspector](https://docs.omni.co/analyze-explore/workbook-inspector#ai-messages).

### Where context applies

Not just Omni Agent — also embedded chat (including topic selection and model search), Workbook Agent query/SQL generation, Dashboard Agent summaries, AI visualization and summary generation, AI filter generation, and the Modeling Agent. A context change affects all of them.

## Writing ai_context

Add via the YAML API:

```bash
omni models yaml-create <modelId> --body '{
  "fileName": "order_transactions.topic",
  "yaml": "base_view: order_items\nlabel: Order Transactions\nai_context: |\n  Map \"revenue\" → total_revenue. Map \"orders\" → count.\n  Map \"customers\" → unique_users.\n  Status values: complete, pending, cancelled, returned.\n  Only complete orders for revenue unless specified otherwise.",
  "mode": "extension",
  "branchId": "{branchId}",
  "commitMessage": "Add AI context to order transactions topic"
}'
```

### What Makes Good ai_context

**Terminology mapping** — map business language to field names:

```yaml
ai_context: |
  "revenue" or "sales" → order_items.total_revenue
  "orders" → order_items.count
  "customers" → users.count or order_items.unique_users
  "AOV" → order_items.average_order_value
```

**Data nuances** — explain what isn't obvious from field names:

```yaml
ai_context: |
  Each row is a line item, not an order. One order has multiple line items.
  total_revenue already excludes returns and cancellations.
  Dates are in UTC.
```

For "map these terms correctly" or "Blobby confuses X with Y", the fix is a **positive mapping in topic-level `ai_context`** — synonyms alone can't arbitrate between two competing measures. If synonyms already exist but the topic context only says what *not* to use, add the missing positive mapping rather than more synonyms.

Good:

```yaml
ai_context: |
  "revenue" or "sales" -> order_items.total_revenue
  "order count" or "number of orders" -> order_items.count
  Never use order_items.count when the user asks for revenue.
```

Avoid stopping at:

```yaml
measures:
  total_revenue:
    synonyms: [revenue, sales]
  count:
    synonyms: [order count, orders]
```

**Behavioral guidance** — direct common patterns:

```yaml
ai_context: |
  For trends, default to weekly granularity, sort ascending.
  For "top N", sort descending and limit to 10.
```

**Persona prompting** — set the analytical perspective:

```yaml
ai_context: |
  You are the head of finance analyzing customer payment data.
  Default to monetary values in USD with 2 decimal places.
```

### Keeping Context Concise

`ai_context` is the one property Omni can't reclaim under pressure, so it is the scarcest budget in the model — not the most generous. Verbose entries evict field metadata first and can ultimately fail the request.

- Target 1-2 sentences per `ai_context` entry. Focus on disambiguation and gotchas, not general explanation.
- Keep labels short and human-readable — avoid redundant qualification (e.g., "Order Total Revenue Amount" → "Total Revenue").
- Rewrite long `description` values to be direct. If a description restates the field name, remove it.

## Model-Level Context

Model-level [`ai_context`](https://docs.omni.co/modeling/models/ai-context) carries guidance shared across every topic, and also informs **topic selection** — useful when Blobby picks the wrong topic rather than the wrong field.

Use it for instance-wide conventions (currency, fiscal calendar, tone, privacy rules) and keep topic-specific mappings on the topic.

There is also a model-level [`sample_queries`](https://docs.omni.co/modeling/models/sample-queries) parameter for example queries that span the model's topics.

## Advanced ai_context Templating

These apply to `ai_context` at the **model, topic, and view levels only**.

### Personalize with user attributes

`{{omni_attributes.<attribute_name>}}` is substituted with the current user's [attribute value](https://docs.omni.co/administration/users/attributes) at query time:

```yaml
ai_context: |
  You are a sales analyst. When someone asks about their team or pipeline,
  always filter by account.segment = {{omni_attributes.segment}}
  and account.region = {{omni_attributes.region}}.
```

> **Caveat**: Not supported in dimension or measure `ai_context` — there the value is used verbatim, un-substituted. Field references and filter conditions are also unsupported and raise a validation warning.

### Target specific model tiers with omni_llm

Scope instructions to the AI model tier — `smartest`, `standard`, or `fastest` — so expensive reasoning instructions don't burden fast models. Sections use Mustache syntax: `{{# ... }}` for "when", `{{^ ... }}` for "when not".

```yaml
ai_context: |
  This topic focuses on financial transactions.

  {{# omni_llm.smartest }}
  For complex multi-table queries, consider indirect relationships and provide rationale for join path selection.
  {{/ omni_llm.smartest }}

  {{# omni_llm.fastest }}
  Prefer single-table queries when possible.
  {{/ omni_llm.fastest }}
```

### Target specific agents with omni_agent

Scope context to the agent that will read it, so bulky agent-specific content doesn't inflate the window for the others:

- `analyze` — model search and query generation
- `build` — topic metadata generation, learn-from-conversation
- `simple_summarize` — tile/visualization summaries, query metadata

```yaml
ai_context: |
  {{# omni_agent.build }}
  Modeling conventions: Always define primary keys. Use snake_case for field names.
  {{/ omni_agent.build }}

  {{^ omni_agent.build }}
  Keep queries focused and efficient.
  {{/ omni_agent.build }}
```

`{{ omni_agent.name }}` interpolates the reading agent's name.

### Reuse blocks with constants

Define [`constants`](https://docs.omni.co/modeling/models/constants#reusable-ai-context) once and reference them with `@{constant_name}` across model, topic, view, and sample-query `ai_context` — the fix for the same tone/privacy/domain paragraph duplicated in a dozen places:

```yaml
constants:
  tone:
    value: "Keep responses concise and professional."
  privacy_high:
    value: "Never show individual customer names or emails."

ai_context: |
  @{tone} @{privacy_high}
```

## Curating Fields with ai_fields

### The real limits

Omni caps how much of the context window model metadata may consume. These caps — not the model's full context window — are what trigger pruning:

| Cap | Value | What happens past it |
|---|---|---|
| A topic's field definitions | ~75K characters | Field properties are pruned in the [pruning order](#pruning-order) |
| Topic-selection summaries (all topics) | ~100K characters | View metadata trimmed first (including view-level `ai_context`), then sample queries, then topic metadata as a last resort. Trimmed detail is recovered once a topic is selected. |
| Searches outside a topic | 100 fields per search | The AI runs narrower repeat searches rather than pruning properties. Applies when [`query_all_views_and_fields`](https://docs.omni.co/modeling/models/parameters/ai-settings/query-all-views-and-fields) is enabled. |

> **Do not optimize against a field count.** A lightly annotated field costs ~100 characters; one with a rich description, sample values, and `ai_context` costs several times that, so the number of fields that fits varies widely. Check the [workbook inspector](https://docs.omni.co/analyze-explore/workbook-inspector#ai-messages) to see the context actually delivered instead of estimating.

Conversation history is budgeted separately — see [`conversation_prune_length`](https://docs.omni.co/modeling/models/parameters/ai-settings/conversation-prune-length).

### Curating

Curate for precision, not just for size: a smaller, well-described field set gives the AI fewer chances to pick the wrong field. Reduce noise for large models:

```yaml
ai_fields:
  - all_views.*
  - -tag:internal
  - -distribution_centers.*

# Or explicit list
ai_fields:
  - order_items.created_at
  - order_items.total_revenue
  - order_items.count
  - users.name
  - users.state
  - products.category
```

Same operators as topic `fields`: wildcard (`*`), negation (`-`), tags (`tag:`).

Tagging is the most maintainable pattern — tag the fields users actually ask about, then curate with a single selector:

```yaml
ai_fields: [tag:use_for_ai]
```

## Controlling Topic Visibility with ai_chat_topics

`ai_chat_topics` is a model-level property that controls which topics Blobby can see:

- **No `ai_chat_topics` property** (default) — Blobby can query across all topics.
- **`ai_chat_topics: []`** (empty list) — Blobby cannot query any topics. This effectively disables AI chat for the model.
- **Explicit list** — only the listed topics (or tag matches) are available. Supports `all_topics`, tag selectors (`tag:customer_facing`), and negation (`-tag:internal`, `-staging_events`).

Check this first — if a topic isn't in `ai_chat_topics`, no amount of `ai_context` or `ai_fields` on it will matter. Use `omni-model-builder` to modify this property.

## Adding sample_queries

Teach Blobby by example. Especially effective for recurring questions and for date-filter patterns Blobby tends to get wrong.

The supported authoring path is through the workbook: build a query that returns the correct answer, then **Model > Save as sample query to topic**. Check **Include in AI context** (otherwise it only shows on the topic overview and never reaches the AI), and fill in the optional **Prompt** and **AI context** fields.

To write one directly in YAML instead — build the correct query in a workbook, retrieve its structure, then add it to the topic:

```yaml
sample_queries:
  revenue_by_month:
    prompt: "What month has the highest revenue?"
    ai_context: "Use total_revenue grouped by month, sorted descending, limit 1"
    query:
      base_view: order_items
      fields:
        - order_items.created_at[month]
        - order_items.total_revenue
      topic: order_transactions
      limit: 1
      sorts:
        - field: order_items.total_revenue
          desc: true
```

> **Note**: When exporting queries from Omni's workbook, you'll get JSON with `table`, `join_paths_from_topic_name`, and `sorts` using `column_name`/`sort_descending`. Map these to YAML as follows:
> - `table` → `base_view`
> - `join_paths_from_topic_name` → `topic`
> - `column_name` → `field`, `sort_descending` → `desc`
> - Workbook JSON includes `filters`, `pivots`, `limit`, `column_limit` which you can include in YAML (though filter syntax requires consulting the [Model YAML API docs](https://docs.omni.co/api/models.md) directly)

Focus on questions users actually ask — if you don't know which those are, ask the user rather than guessing at plausible-sounding ones.

## AI-Specific Topic Extensions

Create a curated topic variant for Blobby using `extends`:

```yaml
# ai_order_transactions.topic
extends: [order_items]
label: AI - Order Transactions

fields:
  - order_items.created_at
  - order_items.status
  - order_items.total_revenue
  - order_items.count
  - users.name
  - users.state
  - products.category

ai_context: |
  Curated view of order data for AI analysis.
  [detailed context here]
```

The extended topic inherits the base topic's joins and filters, so add only what differs: a narrower field set, extra `ai_context`, or `sample_queries` (same shape as above).

## Improving Field Descriptions

Keep the value list in `all_values` and the AI-only rule in `ai_context` — a description that restates either is paying twice for one fact:

```yaml
dimensions:
  status:
    label: Order Status
    description: Current fulfillment status of the order.
    all_values: [complete, pending, cancelled, returned]
    ai_context: Use 'complete' for revenue calculations.
```

### Enumerating Values for Categorical Fields

For closed-set enums, use `all_values` so Blobby knows every valid filter value:

```yaml
dimensions:
  status:
    all_values: [complete, pending, cancelled, returned]
  payment_method:
    all_values: [credit_card, debit_card, bank_transfer, paypal, gift_card]
```

For open-ended categoricals where a full list isn't practical, use `sample_values` to give representative examples:

```yaml
dimensions:
  product_category:
    sample_values: [Electronics, Clothing, Home & Garden, Sports, Books]
  city:
    sample_values: [New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Phoenix]
```

> **Note**: `all_values` is pruned first, so don't count on it surviving in a context-tight topic — put anything load-bearing in `ai_context` instead.

When the [dbt integration](https://docs.omni.co/integrations/dbt/setup) is enabled, dbt `accepted_values` tests are ingested as `all_values` automatically — check before hand-authoring them.

## Adding synonyms

Map alternative names, abbreviations, and domain-specific terminology so Blobby matches user queries to the correct field. Works on both dimensions and measures.

```yaml
dimensions:
  customer_name:
    synonyms: [client, account, buyer, purchaser]
  order_date:
    synonyms: [purchase date, transaction date, order timestamp]

measures:
  total_revenue:
    synonyms: [sales, income, earnings, gross revenue, top line]
  average_order_value:
    synonyms: [AOV, avg order, basket size]
```

**Synonyms vs ai_context**: Use `synonyms` for field-level name mapping. Use `ai_context` for topic-level behavioral guidance, data nuances, and multi-field relationships.

**When to add them** — synonyms earn their place when users genuinely say a word the model doesn't contain (`AOV`, `top line`, `basket size`). They do not earn it by restating the field's label or name, or by reinforcing a mapping topic-level `ai_context` already makes. Adding synonyms to a field whose disambiguation is already handled on the topic is the most common wasted write in this skill — see [Safe Model Write Defaults](#safe-model-write-defaults).

**Pruning**: `synonyms` are pruned **last**, after `description` and `label`. So for a field that genuinely needs alternate vocabulary, synonyms are the most durable place to put it — but that survivability is a reason to choose synonyms *over* a description for that purpose, never a reason to add more of them.

## Avoiding Duplication

`ai_context` and `description` serve different audiences. `description` is human-facing (shown in the field picker and docs). `ai_context` is an AI-only hint. Don't put the same text in both — `ai_context` should add guidance the description doesn't cover (disambiguation, gotchas, when to use one field over another).

**Consolidate shared context at the view level.** If multiple fields in a view share the same `ai_context` (e.g., "all monetary values are in USD"), move it to the view-level `ai_context` instead of repeating it on each field. Field-level `ai_context` should be specific to that field.

Shared fact hoisted to the view, `description` and `ai_context` each carrying only what the other doesn't:

```yaml
ai_context: "All monetary values in this view are in USD."

dimensions:
  gross_revenue:
    ai_context: "Revenue before refunds."
    description: "Total revenue before refunds and cancellations are applied."
  net_revenue:
    ai_context: "Revenue after refunds. Use this for profitability analysis."
    description: "Total revenue after refunds and cancellations."
```

## Optimization Checklist

Prioritize high-impact changes. Improve wording without changing semantics.

1. Inspect current state with `omni-model-explorer`
2. Check model-level `ai_chat_topics` — ensure the right topics are visible to AI
3. Curate with `ai_fields` down to the fields users actually ask about, rather than to a field count
4. Write `ai_context` mapping business terms to fields (keep to 1-2 sentences; it is never pruned)
5. Add `synonyms` to key dimensions and measures (skip if they duplicate the label)
6. Improve field `description` and `label` values
7. Add `all_values`/`sample_values` for categorical fields
8. Add `sample_queries` for top 3-5 questions
9. Remove duplication between `ai_context` and `description`; consolidate shared context at view level, and shared blocks into `constants`
10. Consider `extends` for AI-specific topic variants
11. Scope tier- or agent-specific instructions with `omni_llm` / `omni_agent` rather than paying for them on every request
12. Test iteratively — ask Blobby and refine

> **Troubleshooting order** when Blobby answers wrong: confirm the topic is reachable (`ai_chat_topics`) → confirm the field is in context (workbook inspector; check it wasn't pruned or excluded by `ai_fields`/`hidden`) → then add or sharpen `ai_context`. Writing more context for a field the AI never received fixes nothing.

## AI Model Suggestions

Omni can generate model-improvement suggestions itself (CLI ≥ 1.1.2, `omni ai-model-suggestions --help`). Use these as a complement to the manual checklist above — review each suggestion before applying it:

```bash
# Kick off a generation run, then read it back
omni ai-model-suggestions model-suggestions-generate <modelId>
omni ai-model-suggestions model-suggestions-run-latest <modelId>
omni ai-model-suggestions model-suggestions-run-get <modelId> <runId>

# Work the suggestion list
omni ai-model-suggestions model-suggestions-list <modelId>
omni ai-model-suggestions model-suggestions-ignore <modelId> <suggestionId>
omni ai-model-suggestions model-suggestions-restore <modelId> <suggestionId>
omni ai-model-suggestions model-suggestions-delete <modelId> <suggestionId>

# Recurring generation
omni ai-model-suggestions model-suggestions-schedule-enable <modelId>
omni ai-model-suggestions model-suggestions-schedule-disable <modelId>
```

## Agent Skills

A skill is a saved set of instructions the Omni Agent loads when a user invokes its slash-command handle (e.g. `/quarterly-report`). Where `ai_context` shapes every answer on a topic, a skill packages one repeatable task. Manage them with `omni skills` (CLI ≥ 1.3.1; experimental, so fields may still change). Run `create` / `update` with `--schema` for the body.

```bash
omni skills list                                   # bodies omitted
omni skills list --identifier quarterly-report     # filter by handle; exact match, still returns a list
omni skills list --q revenue                       # free-text search (CLI ≥ 1.4.0)
omni skills get <skillId>                          # includes the body
omni skills create --body @skill.json              # name, identifier, description, body
omni skills update <skillId> --body '{ "body": "…" }'
omni skills delete <skillId>
```

- **`list` is scoped to the caller.** An org admin sees every skill in the organization; anyone else sees only their own, and `--creator-id` / `--q` narrow within that — neither widens it. An empty list from a non-admin key is not evidence that no skill holds a handle — `create` still 409s on a handle held by someone else's skill.
- **`list` never returns `body`.** Read a skill's instructions with `get`, not from the list.
- **`description` is what the agent chooses between skills on**, so write it the way you would a good `ai_context` line: what the skill is for and when it applies.
- `delete` is a soft delete: the skill vanishes from every read and its handle is free to reuse.
