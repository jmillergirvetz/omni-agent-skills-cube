# Changelog

All notable changes to this repository will be documented in this file.

Changelog tracking begins with the next release. Historical releases are not backfilled.

Since 1.11.0 both plugins share one version, held in `versions.json` and stamped into the manifests by CI. Entries below 1.11.0 use the older scheme, where the heading number belonged to whichever plugin that release was for — which is why those version numbers do not read in order.

> **Note on numbering.** The Cube integration was developed on a fork while upstream
> released 1.17.0–1.19.0 independently. Both entries below were authored as 1.16.0 and
> 1.17.0 on the fork and are renumbered to 1.20.0 here, which is where they land after
> merging upstream.

## [1.20.0] - 2026-10-01

### omni-integrations

_Summary: a mapping review of the Cube integration corrected seven limitations that understated what Omni can express, and added a lineage-notation scheme so a synced model records where each object came from and what was dropped. Both directional skills now enforce the notation and annotate every user-attribute-dependent parameter._

**Fixed** — seven mappings were wrong or pessimistic, each re-checked against current Omni docs:
- **Dimension `mask` / `meta.member_masking` was listed as a hard blocker.** It is not: [`mask_unless_access_grants`](https://docs.omni.co/modeling/dimensions/parameters/mask-unless-access-grants.md) masks the *value* (MD5) rather than hiding the field, so aggregation still works. Cube's *chosen* mask value (`mask: -1`, `mask: {sql: …}`) maps too — one companion dimension per masking variant, each gated by complementary [`access_grants`](https://docs.omni.co/modeling/models/access-grants.md) keyed to different `allowed_values` of one user attribute, which permits more tiers than Cube's single mask. Caveats now stated: one field per variant, grants must be mutually exclusive and exhaustive, and **grants do not propagate through a measure** that references the masked dimension.
- **`calendar` cubes.** Retail 4-5-4 is a documented [`custom_calendars`](https://docs.omni.co/modeling/models/custom-calendars.md) example, so "a true custom calendar table does not map" was wrong. Added the real constraint: a custom calendar **replaces** the fiscal calendar on the dimensions using it — `fiscal_month_offset` and the `fiscal_*` timeframes become unavailable *on those dimensions*; the two coexist in one model only across different dimensions.
- **`type: string` / `time` / `boolean` measures.** These are superfluous, not awkward: Omni infers datatype from the warehouse and accepts raw aggregate SQL with no `aggregate_type` (`sql: BOOL_OR(${x})`), which Omni's own docs endorse. Drop the Cube `type:`; the expression ports directly. ⚠️ → ✅.
- **`dimension.type: switch`.** The enum constraint *is* enforceable — a filter-only field with `suggestion_list` + `filter_single_select_only`. Also records that `display_order` is not a substitute (it orders the field in the picker and constrains nothing).
- **Custom `granularities`.** A custom grain is just a derived dimension given the base timestamp's `group_label` so it sits beside the default timeframes; calendar-based grains go through `custom_calendars` `mappings`. ❌ → ⚠️. Notes that `duration` is *not* this — it measures elapsed time between two timestamps.
- **`propagate_filters_to_sub_query`.** Has an equivalent after all: a query view's `bind_all_filters` (plus `bind`, `bind_outer_context`). ❌ → ⚠️, with the caveat that predicate pushdown into a Cube *pre-aggregation* is caching behavior Omni has no analog for.
- **`segments`.** Omni has no object named segment, but every property that matters maps — a boolean dimension is directly filterable, and `template: true` + `extends` gives Cube's reusability. Corrects the mechanism: a template view is reachable **only via `extends`**, never joined or named in `always_where`.
- Reverse-direction rows reconciled so the two mapping tables cannot contradict each other: `groups`/`else` and `bin_boundaries` map to Cube's dimension `case`; templated filters split into the constrained-enum half (maps to `switch`) and the Mustache value-injection half (no analog).

**Added**
- **`NOTATION.md` — the lineage-notation scheme.** One comment per field (`# cube: <cube>.<member> · <path>`, `· PARTIAL` with an `omni:` continuation when only some sub-parameters came from Cube, `# omni-native:` when nothing did, `· VERIFY:` when a value needs checking) and one header block per model/topic/view carrying provenance plus **every dropped member by name**. Deliberately budgeted at one comment per object so field definitions stay readable, with greppable tokens (`# cube:` / `PARTIAL` / `VERIFY:` / `# omni-native:`) making a synced model auditable from the shell.
- **Drop-and-record policy.** Anything not even partially mappable is dropped from the YAML rather than approximated, then named in the parent model/topic/view header block — a dropped member has no YAML left to annotate, so the parent block is its only trace. Counts without names are explicitly disallowed.
- **User-attribute annotations.** Every user-attribute-dependent parameter (`access_filters`, `required_access_grants`, `hidden_unless_access_grants`, `mask_unless_access_grants`, `access_grants`, `default_topic_access_filters`, `dynamic_shared_extensions`) now carries the attribute names, a link to [user attributes](https://docs.omni.co/administration/users/attributes.md), and a post-promotion check via [View as](https://docs.omni.co/visualize-present/dashboards/view-as.md). The skills state the silent-failure mode plainly: a missing or unassigned attribute **does not fail validation** — the model validates, the query runs, and the filter does not constrain.
- **A header-vs-field consistency check.** Derive the header's `partial —` list with `grep` rather than writing it by hand, and hold three invariants (header list matches the markers; every drop named; exactly one comment per field). This came out of the authoring run: a header block claimed 2 `PARTIAL` fields where the file carried 6, and a header that undercounts hides work someone has to finish.
- Four new eval cases (7 per directional skill, up from 5) covering the notation scheme, user-attribute annotation, and the templated-filter split. The masking eval was **rewritten** — it previously asserted "Omni has no field-value masking primitive" and would have rewarded the wrong answer.

**Verified against the live Omni branch:** the notated view was written through `yaml-create`, validated clean, and read back with the header block and all field-level `PARTIAL` / `VERIFY` comments intact and still attached to their keys. Omni hoists `label` / `description` above a header block and prepends its own `# Reference this view as …`, so a header survives but never stays on line one — never write a comment whose meaning depends on its position.

## [1.20.0] - 2026-10-01 (initial Cube integration)

### omni-integrations

_Summary: a bidirectional Cube (cube.dev) integration — three new skills that sync a Cube semantic model into Omni views/topics/relationships, sync Omni model logic back into Cube cubes/views/joins, and orchestrate the pipeline across both platforms' branch models. Branching is the default on both sides and merging stays a user-initiated step. The Cube-side work delegates to Cube's official `cube-agent-skills`; the Omni-side work delegates to `omni-model-builder` / `omni-model-explorer`. No existing skill changed behavior._

**Added**
- **`cube-omni-pipeline` — the hub and help guide.** Routes a request to a direction, detects the Cube edition, choreographs the branch pair, and answers the recurring questions (how a Cube change reaches Omni in dev and once deployed, which platform should own a metric, whether continuous two-way sync is possible). References: `SETUP.md` (prerequisites, install, auth, the local Cube Core Docker instance, required env vars), `EDITIONS.md` (Cube Cloud vs. Cube Core capability matrix), `PIPELINE.md` (the ordered steps both directions plus a side-by-side command reference and the Omni-on-Cube-SQL-API alternative), `BRANCHING.md` (branch policy, identifier cheat sheet, paired-branch workflow, parity check), `LIMITATIONS.md` (everything that does not survive a sync, per direction).
- **`cube-to-omni`.** Reads a Cube model — authored YAML for logic, compiled model for exposure — and writes Omni view, topic and relationship YAML to a branch, then validates, test-queries, and runs a numeric parity check against Cube. `references/FIELD-MAPPING.md` gives the parameter-by-parameter translation (object level, cubes, dimensions, time/granularity, measures and aggregate types, joins, views→topics) with a worked end-to-end example.
- **`omni-to-cube`.** Reads an Omni model and writes Cube cubes, views and joins on a dev-mode branch (Cloud) or a git branch (Core), then builds, confirms exposure, and parity-checks. `references/FIELD-MAPPING.md` covers the reverse translation including the timeframe expansion into derived dimensions and the aggregate types with no Cube equivalent.
- **Explicit mapping and limitation callouts in both directions.** Hard blockers (`pre_aggregations`, dimension `mask`, `rolling_window`, dynamic JS/Jinja models, multi-`data_source` cubes; and on the Omni side `synonyms`/`sample_queries`/`ai_fields`, the `*_distinct_on` aggregates, composite topics, templated filters) are reported rather than approximated; lossy mappings name their specific consequence.
- **Branch-by-default policy across both platforms.** No branch named means ask in an interactive session and create-and-report in auto-mode, never an unbranched write. Merge, promote, `cube deploy` and PR merges are user-initiated, mirroring the existing `omni-model-builder` hard stop.
- **Evals.** Five cases per skill covering edition detection, branch discipline, reference-syntax rewriting, the unmappable-feature reports, and refusing to claim continuous two-way sync.

**Verified with a live round trip and a numeric parity check.** A Cube model was translated to Omni views + `relationships` + a topic on a branch, validated clean, and test-queried; then both platforms were pointed at the same Snowflake tables (key-pair auth) and the same aggregate compared row for row — **32/32 values agreed numerically** across 8 groups x 4 measures (sum, filtered sum, count distinct, count) over 848,768 fact rows. Several documented gotchas come from that run: the compiled model carries **no** `sql` expressions, a measure-level `filter` returns **NULL rather than 0** for groups with no matching rows, `prefix: true` renames view members to `<cube>_<member>`, segments and hierarchies do **not** propagate into views, and a dimension `case` cannot coexist with `sql`. Two operational traps were also found and documented: the two platforms' number serialization differs (JSON floats vs Arrow doubles), so parity must be compared numerically rather than as strings; and a second local Cube project silently keeps answering on port 4000, which will parity-check the wrong model. Cube Cloud-only surfaces (dev-mode branches, `cube data-model`, `cube meta`, build status) are documented from Cube's published docs and marked as not validated here.
## [1.19.0] - 2026-10-01

### omni-integrations

**Changed**
- **`omni-to-dbt-metricflow` — filter dependencies survive the drop list.** Step 4 is now three ordered passes: candidates, drops, dependencies. The dependency pass adds the primary key of every touched view and each kept measure's filter and `sql` dimensions, even when the drop pass removed them as `hidden: true` or as not selected by the topic. A measure whose dependency is filter-only, in a skipped view, or a cross-view expression is dropped and reported. Before, a view or topic export could drop a hidden dimension that a measure filters on; `dbt parse` and `mf validate-configs` pass, and only `mf query --explain` fails.
- **`omni-to-dbt-metricflow` — same-view filters keep the group.** A same-view predicate now goes inside `expr` for every aggregate type (`count`: `THEN 1 END`, `sum`: `THEN <column> ELSE 0 END`, others: `THEN <column> END`), which is the SQL Omni generates itself, so the group stays present with the same value. The note on differences now states them exactly: only a cross-view metric `filter` differs, where the group is absent when queried alone and NULL when queried with other metrics, and Omni shows 0 for `count`, `count_distinct`, and `sum`. Step 9 tests a filtered metric alone and with an unfiltered one.
- **`omni-to-dbt-metricflow` — week start day.** New note: MetricFlow has no per-model week start; its standard week is Monday on every adapter except Snowflake, where `DATE_TRUNC('week')` follows `WEEK_START`. FIELD-MAPPING.md documents a custom-granularity time-spine column for an Omni `week_start_day`, built from a fixed anchor date with dbt cross-db macros so it does not depend on the adapter's `DATE_TRUNC('week')` (Sunday on dbt-bigquery, `WEEK_START` on Snowflake). Omni's own weekly results are unchanged after fallback.

## [1.18.0] - 2026-09-28

### omni-analytics

_Summary: `omni-content-builder` was re-checked against the current documents v2 API. Four things it warned about now behave differently, some missing options were added, and the skill now recommends one path wherever it used to list two. The check that runs each tile's query now reads its row count from JSON output. No command or flag changed._

**Fixed**
- **`omni-content-builder` — *Checking each tile's query*.** The validation reference ran each tile's query with `"resultType": "csv"`, whose output is only the CSV, and then read the row count from `cache_metadata.num_rows`, which that output does not have. The check now runs with `-o json`, which keeps the job envelope, and a CSV run is a separate spot-check of the data.

**Changed**
- **`omni-content-builder` — *Reading a tile's chart config*.** A tile's chart config now reads back in the same shape you write it. The warnings about a flattened read, and the `normalizeTile()` helper, are gone. After writing a tile, read it back and check that its `config` is not empty.
- **`omni-content-builder` — *Hiding a control*.** A control's `hidden` flag is no longer accepted in a patch. A control shows wherever a container places it, so hide one by leaving it out of every container.
- **`omni-content-builder` — *Where new tiles go*.** When a create or patch has no `containers`, every new tile is placed on the first page automatically. Send `containers` to place tiles yourself. This replaces the old note that only the first tile was laid out.
- **`omni-content-builder` — *What a read returns*.** `v2-get` with a document's identifier returns the published document, never draft edits. A draft comes from `v2-get-draft`, or from `v2-get` with the draft's own identifier. Every read includes `modelId` and `workbookModelId`. `branchId` is accepted only on the patch that creates a draft. `v2-update-identifier` is now in the command tables, and SKILL.md's table also lists the query-model binding commands.
- **`omni-content-builder` — *Newly documented options*.** Tile types (`foreign` replaces `app`, and a `linked` tile needs `sourceQueryPresentationKey`), the `treemap` and `svgMap` charts, percent stacking (`stack_percentage`, not `normalize`), filter metadata, `FIELD_PICKER` field order, four more layout items (spacer, divider, placeholder, text), stack and grid options, the page `breakpoint`, the 15-page limit, and length caps on names and subtitles. One unverified claim about inline filters was removed.
- **`omni-content-builder` — *Model a filter, or add a control*.** A new paragraph on when a filter belongs in the model as a filter-only field rather than on the dashboard as a control.
- **`omni-content-builder` — *Filter control type must match the filter type*.** `singleValueEquals` / `multiValueEquals` belong on `string` filters and `singleDay` / `timeframe` on `date` filters. The API doesn't check the pairing, and a `number` filter set to single selection drops every value a viewer picks. For buttons or a dropdown on a number field, a new section shows filtering on a text copy of the field, with `order_by_field` keeping the choices in numeric order.
- **`omni-content-builder` — *One recommended path*.** Wherever the skill named two ways to do something, it now says which to use and when. For example, `list-drafts` is the lookup for a draft's workbook model id, and fields go in the JSON body whenever a request has one.
- **`omni-content-builder` — *A shorter SKILL.md*.** SKILL.md drops from about 11.6k to about 5.9k tokens (487 to 198 lines). Document lifecycle examples and build workflows, the workbook-model field workflow, and dashboard downloads move into their own references (`document-lifecycle.md`, `workbook-model.md`, `downloads.md`); the controls create example and the model-or-control criteria move into `controls.md`. Long Known Issues entries keep the rule and link to the detail, and entries whose error message already explains the fix now live only in `documents-v2.md`'s error map. Every reference over 100 lines opens with a table of contents. The create example's date filter now uses the object form.
- **`omni-content-builder` — *Headless by default*.** The skill no longer asks the agent to build anything in the Omni UI. Chart and filter configs come from the recipes or from reading back an existing dashboard, the UI-first workflow is gone, and a classic-layout dashboard is upgraded with `omni documents upgrade-layout`, which publishes immediately, so the agent confirms with the user first. A browser check of the rendered dashboard stays optional for when a browser is reachable; `validation-and-testing.md` lists how to work with a dashboard page that never goes idle.
- **`omni-api-conventions` rule — *`--schema` and the API*.** `--schema` describes the installed CLI build, which can lag the API. When it disagrees with a doc, keep the CLI current and confirm with a live call.
- **`omni-content-builder` — *Evals*.** Six cases updated and three added: hiding a control by placement, adding a tile without `containers`, and renaming a tile read from a draft.

## [1.17.0] - 2026-09-24

### omni-analytics

_Summary: sync skills with Omni CLI v1.4.0. The release renames the eight document **app** commands (`documents v2-get-app` → `get-app`, and so on — paths and payloads unchanged), adds `user-attributes create` / `update` / `delete`, `users delete-email-only-bulk` and `skills list --q`, removes `dashboards get-filters` / `update-filters`, and syncs the API spec, which newly documents `schedules update` as a full replacement, `ai conversation-detail` as the way to read an eval run's conversation, and `documents v2-get` accepting a draft's own identifier. 245 commands, up from 243. Every behavior below was checked against the released 1.4.0 binary with `--help` and `--schema`._

**Added**
- **`omni-admin` — *User attribute definitions*.** `omni user-attributes create` / `update <id>` / `delete <id>`, replacing the old instruction to send the user to Admin → User Attributes when a definition is missing. The naming and type rules are left to `--help`, which fails loudly on them; the two behaviors that do not announce themselves are written down: what `delete` takes with it beyond the definition — every user value, embed SSO logins that still pass the name (an embed lockout), model SQL that references it, and connection-environment selection, which silently falls back to the default connection — and `Number` values being stored as strings, with a JSON number past 2^53 - 1 silently rounded on the way in (`9007199254740993` stores as `"9007199254740992"`).
- **`omni-admin` — *Email-only users*.** The `users list-email-only` / `create-email-only` / `create-email-only-bulk` family beside Schedules, where these recipients are used, and the new `users delete-email-only-bulk` — which is partially successful by design, returning unmatched identifiers under `notFound` while the rest of the request still deletes.
- **`omni-ai-eval` — *Reading a judged conversation*.** `omni ai conversation-detail <conversationId>` reads the transcript behind a `results[].agentic_job.conversation_id`, so a failure rationale no longer has to be chased through the UI. Eval conversations never appear in `ai conversations-list`, and **assistant text is retained for 30 days** — past that the call still returns 200, with only the user turns.
- **`omni-ai-optimizer` — `skills list --q`.** Free-text search over name, handle and description, against `--identifier`'s exact handle match. Like `--creator-id`, it narrows within what the caller can already see and never widens it.

**Changed**
- **`omni-content-builder` — app commands lost their `v2-` prefix.** `documents v2-get-app`, `v2-get-draft-app`, `v2-get-main-draft-app`, `v2-put-app`, `v2-put-app-auto-draft`, `v2-patch-app`, `v2-patch-app-auto-draft` and `v2-remove-app` are now `get-app` … `remove-app`; arguments, paths and payloads are unchanged. SKILL.md's command table and `references/documents-v2.md` use the new names, with a note that 1.2.2–1.3.1 spell them with the prefix. The rest of the `documents v2-*` surface (`v2-create`, `v2-patch-draft`, `v2-publish-draft`, `v2-remove-dashboard`, …) keeps its prefix.
- **`omni-content-builder` — `v2-get` on a draft identifier.** Passing a draft's own identifier reads that draft; the response carries `draftOf`, naming the published document — the way to build the `<identifier> <draftIdentifier>` pair when only the draft identifier is known.
- **`omni-admin` — `schedules update` is a full replacement**, and returns `"success": true` either way. Any optional property left out is reset to its default — filter values cleared, the alert condition removed, `maxRowLimit` and the presentation flags back to defaults — and the read shape is not the write shape, so `schedules get` cannot be round-tripped into it (the GET nests presentation options under `metadata` and recipients under `destinations[]`, and feeding it straight back 400s on `destinationType`). The full list of what resets is left to `--help`.

**Removed**
- **`dashboards get-filters` / `dashboards update-filters` are gone from the CLI.** No skill, agent, or rule referenced them, so nothing in this repo changed; noted here because a caller's own scripts will now get an unknown-command error.

## [1.16.0] - 2026-09-24

### omni-analytics

_Summary: `omni-query` and `omni-content-explorer` both documented `omni documents get-queries`, and neither description said which one owns "what does this tile actually query" — so the same request could reach either. The boundary is now stated in both descriptions: content-explorer locates and organizes content, omni-query explains and extracts what a query does. No command or flag changed._

**Changed**
- **`omni-query` — *Description*.** Now claims inspecting the query definition behind a dashboard tile. Paid for within the description length budget by dropping "or workbook" from the adjacent extract-data phrase; the description sits at 1007 of 1024 characters.
- **`omni-content-explorer` — *Description*.** Now says explicitly that it locates and organizes content, and points at `omni-query` for a tile's fields, filters, and sorts — which is what its own `get-queries` note already said in the body.
- **Evals.** The `omni-content-explorer` case that asked for a dashboard's underlying query fields moves to `omni-query` (case 19). It called `get-queries` and duplicated an existing `omni-query` case, so two near-identical prompts carried opposite `expected_skill` labels.

## [1.15.0] - 2026-09-21

### omni-analytics

_Summary: four modeling features the skills did not cover — aggregate awareness (`materialized_query`), composite topics, templated filters (filter-only fields), and level of detail — each now has a reference in `omni-model-builder` with worked shapes checked against the current release, plus the query and explorer notes needed to use them. The content-builder skill gains dashboard design defaults from Omni's Dashboarding Best Practices guide. No command or flag changed._

**Added**
- **`omni-model-builder` — *Aggregate awareness*.** `references/aggregate-awareness.md`: declaring `materialized_query`, pinning a table to a filter value (a filter-only field included), what a table serves by timeframe and aggregate type, joined views, and confirming a rewrite with `planOnly`.
- **`omni-model-builder` — *Composite topics*.** `references/composite-topics.md`: the `.composite_topic` file, when a cross-fact metric is a composite at all, `shared_views`, `shared_dimensions`, `shared_measures` and its limits, `unrelated_dimension_handling`, the two-lens `extends` pattern, query addressing, and how member queries use member-topic aggregate tables.
- **`omni-model-builder` — *Templated filters*.** `references/templated-filters.md`: filter-only fields, `bind_to` (WHERE for dimensions, HAVING for measures), the Mustache tokens, four dynamic-field shapes (date basis, metric switcher, numeric threshold, section block with a default), query and control binding, validating through executed SQL.
- **`omni-model-builder` — *Level of detail*.** `references/level-of-detail.md`: `fixed` / `always_include` / `always_exclude`, grain matching, the idempotent outer aggregate for `always_exclude`, header amounts across line detail against a composite with `repeat`, a per-query grain from a templated `fixed:` target, reuse through field-level `extends`.
- **`omni-content-builder` — *Design defaults*.** A short section in `SKILL.md` (lead with the answer top-left, three to five charts per page, neutral palette with one accent, chart type by question, controls beside what they drive with action-oriented labels, a parent control to hide complexity, charts that read without hovering), stated as defaults that never override direction the user gives, with placement guidance in `containers.md` and the parent-control pattern in `controls.md` linked back to the guide.
- **`omni-model-builder` — *Evals*.** Seven cases covering the four features: an aggregate table with a proven rewrite, a composite build, date-basis pins, a dynamic date switch, a many-side flag rolled up, a header amount across line detail, and a `fixed:` grain that is wrong on a second report.

**Changed**
- **`omni-model-builder` — SKILL.md.** Reach-for-it pointers for the four features, a `.composite_topic` file-type row, trigger terms in the skill description, `sql:` versus `query:` for rollup query views, and composite and view rows in the parameter tables.
- **`omni-model-builder` — *Query views*.** `references/query-view-examples.md` gains a many-side rollup in both forms; `${view.field}` in a `sql:` block expands at save time and needs an aliased `FROM`, and a `sql:` query view has no automatic `count`.
- **`omni-query` — *Date `BETWEEN`*.** The end of a date `BETWEEN` is exclusive (`>= start AND < end`), not inclusive as previously stated; a whole year ends on the first day of the next year. Number `BETWEEN` stays inclusive at both ends.
- **`omni-query` — *Composite topics*.** Querying one (no `table`, `@`-prefixed addressing, per-member filters) and confirming an aggregate table served a query.
- **`omni-model-explorer` — *Composite topics*.** What `get-topic` returns for one.

## [1.14.0] - 2026-09-16

### omni-integrations

**Added**
- **`omni-to-dbt-metricflow` — move Omni logic into the dbt Semantic Layer.** Exports Omni view and relationship logic (scoped by a field list, a view, or a topic) to dbt MetricFlow YAML, checks every emitted name against the dbt project before writing, validates it with dbt and mf, and adds the `FALLBACK-TO-DBT.md` reference for the last step: once a dbt sync brings the definition in, remove the Omni model-layer override so Omni falls back to dbt. The procedure was validated on a live Omni instance.

## [1.13.0] - 2026-09-15

### omni-analytics

_Summary: sync skills with Omni CLI v1.3.1. The release adds two command groups, `skills` and `color-palettes` (243 commands, up from 233), and syncs the API spec: `query run` documents the `cache` values the API accepts, `query wait --job-ids` is no longer required client-side, `models content-validator-get` gains `--force-full-validation`, list endpoints document their page-size and sort enums, and topic and AI job-result responses gain composite-topic and per-action `status` schemas. No command or flag was removed. Every behavior below was checked against the released 1.3.1 binary._

**Added**
- **`omni-ai-optimizer` — *Agent Skills*.** `omni skills` list / get / create / update / delete, with the behaviors that do not surface as errors: `list` is scoped to the caller for non-admins and omits `body`, and a skill's `description` is what the agent picks between skills on.
- **`omni-admin` — *Color Palettes*.** `omni color-palettes` commands; `list` excludes built-in palettes, and an update or delete changes every chart using the palette without saying which.
- **`omni-model-explorer` — composite topics.** `list-topics` mixes regular and composite topics; a composite entry has `is_composite: true`, component `topics[]`, and no `base_view_name`.
- **Content validator — `--force-full-validation`** (`omni-model-explorer`, `omni-admin`, `omni-model-builder` schema-refresh reference). On large content the validator checks references without planning queries, so a clean result can miss queries that no longer plan.

**Changed**
- **`omni-query` — `cache` values.** Adds `SkipCacheAndRebuildExtracts`.
- **`omni-query` — async job actions.** Each action's `status` (`complete` / `partial` / `skipped` / `failed`) is separate from `result.status`; a `partial` action with a successful query still answered less than was asked.
- **`omni-content-builder` — app write warnings.** `warnings` also flags `settings.allowDefaultMapProviders` when the org's app policy turns map providers off; the setting saves but no map tile loads.
- **`omni-api-conventions` rule.** `query wait --job-ids` leaves the list of client-side required flags, and the `--schema` enum-drift caveat drops the `query run` `cache` example now that the schema lists the accepted values.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-09-15

### omni-analytics

_Summary: sync skills with Omni CLI v1.3.0. The command set is identical to 1.2.2 and no request or response schema changed; the release adds four presentation flags — `--chart`, `--chart-value`, `--chart-rows`, `--workbook` — and renders `query run` / `query wait` results as formatted tables in human mode. JSON-mode output is unchanged. Every behavior below was probed against the released 1.3.0 binary._

**Added**
- **`omni-query` — `--workbook` and `workbookUrl`.** New row in *Request-level options*: the ephemeral-workbook link comes back in a response header, printed under human output or as `{"workbookUrl": …}` on **stderr** in JSON mode, and is **silently omitted** when the user lacks the workbooks permission on the model.
- **`omni-query` — *Showing results to a person*.** Human-mode tables and `--chart` bar tables for presenting results, with the caveat that neither carries the job envelope, so validation stays a JSON-mode step.

**Changed**
- **`omni-query` — NDJSON and long-running queries.** The NDJSON warning now applies to JSON mode, and says to pass `-o json` when parsing. *Long-Running Queries* notes that JSON mode never polls: `remaining_job_ids` in the footer is the only sign a result is incomplete.
- **`omni-api-conventions` rule — Output.** Pass `-o json` explicitly when parsing, since a default from `omni config set-format` or `OMNI_OUTPUT_FORMAT` also applies to piped calls and turns `query run` into a rendered table. Keep stderr out of stdout, since `--workbook` writes its link there on a successful call.

**Fixed**
- **`omni-admin` — connection environments.** The Connections example called a list command the CLI does not have; it now points at `connection-environments-create --schema` and names the create / update / delete operations.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-09-10

_Both plugins move to a single shared version with this release. They ship from
the same repo at the same commit, so `omni-integrations` jumps from 1.2.2 to
match._

### omni-analytics

**Changed**
- **Versions now come from `versions.json`.** One line at the repo root is stamped into all ten version fields across the six manifests by CI on merge, so a release bump no longer conflicts with every other PR in flight. A `guard` check fails any PR that hand-writes a version disagreeing with the source of truth. See CONTRIBUTING.md → *Versioning and Changelog*.

### omni-integrations

**Changed**
- Version realigned from 1.2.2 to the shared repo version. No functional change.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-09-10

### omni-analytics

_Summary: sync skills with Omni CLI v1.2.1 and v1.2.2. 1.2.2 adds the **alpha app sub-resource** on documents v2 (8 commands), `models delete`, and `ai job-feedback-submit`, and **removes** the v1 document write endpoints (`documents update` / `documents put`); 1.2.1 adds update notifications. Every command and body shape below was probed against the released 1.2.2 binary with `--help` / `--schema`._

**Added**
- **`omni-content-builder` — apps (alpha).** A document can now carry HTML content in place of a dashboard. New *Apps* section in `references/documents-v2.md` covering the eight `documents v2-*-app` commands, the `app` slice on `v2-create` (mutually exclusive with `containers` / `controls` / `settings`), the dashboard-XOR-app rule, `PUT`-creates / `PATCH`-doesn't and the differing 409 gates on `v2-patch-app` (no app on the draft) versus `v2-patch-app-auto-draft` (no *published* app), last-write-wins on `PUT` versus all-or-nothing content-addressed `htmlEdits` on `PATCH` — which detects a stale read but is **not** concurrency safety — the 2 MiB HTML cap, the `allowCreateApps` / org-toggle creation gates behind an otherwise-bare 403, and the silent-failure mode that matters most: **writes never reject on host policy**, so an app pulling a disallowed CDN host returns 200 with a non-blocking `warnings` entry and then renders blank under the CSP. Per-command detail is left to `--help` / `--schema`, which carry it verbatim from the spec.
- **`omni-model-builder` — `models delete`.** Trashes a SHARED or shared-extension model together with the workbooks, dashboards, and child extension models built on it; requires Connection Admin. Flagged for user confirmation because of that blast radius, and distinguished from `models delete-branch`.
- **`omni-query` — `ai job-feedback-submit`.** Thumbs up/down (plus optional comment) on a finished AI job, with the `COMPLETE`/`FAILED`-only 409 gate and the append-only, never-read-back caveat.
- **`omni-api-conventions` rule — `omni update check`** (CLI ≥ 1.2.1) as the follow-up when a capability probe fails: it reports `currentVersion` / `latestVersion` and an `upgrade` object carrying both the `brew` and `install.sh` commands. Documented as *offer the user both* — it does no install-method detection — with the `v`-prefix mismatch that makes a naive string compare of the two versions never match.

**Fixed**
- **The v1 document write commands are gone.** `PATCH`/`PUT /api/v1/documents/{identifier}` were removed from the API, so `documents update` / `documents put` no longer exist in the CLI. `omni-content-builder` (SKILL.md and `references/documents-v2.md`) told agents "never fall back to v1 `create`/`get`/`put`/`update`" — the two removed verbs are dropped from that list, since naming a nonexistent command as a tempting fallback is worse than not naming it. `omni-query`'s `references/job-result-to-presentation.md` pointed at `omni documents create` "or a dashboard PUT" and now points at `v2-create` / `v2-patch-draft`.

## [1.9.1] - 2026-09-03

### omni-analytics

**Fixed**
- **`omni-model-builder` cross-view field placement** — clarifies that topic-scoped fields retain the requested `<view>.<field>` query namespace, and bases global-versus-topic placement on intended availability plus each topic's resolved join map. Documents the reproduced boundary: topics may inherit global relationships, while an explicit/frozen join map can omit a dependency and produce blocking `field_broken_in_topic` validation. Adds a topic-only regression eval for a measure stored under `views.order_items.measures` and queried as `order_items.revenue_per_user`.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-09-02

### omni-analytics

_Summary: sync skills with Omni CLI v1.2.0. This release added no commands — the command set is identical at 242 — so it is a **behavior and ergonomics** sync: kebab-case flag names, `--schema` on every command (plus response shapes), `--body @file`, client-side required-flag validation, and real flags for the multipart `uploads` commands. All 242 commands and 114 renamed flags were diffed between 1.1.2 and 1.2.0 and probed against the released binary; **no breaking changes** — every old flag spelling is still accepted as an alias, so pre-1.2.0 CLIs keep working._

**Changed**
- **Flag names normalized to kebab-case across all skills, agents, and rules (69 occurrences).** `--pagesize` → `--page-size`, `--userid` → `--user-id`, `--branchid` → `--branch-id`, `--filename` → `--file-name`, `--sortfield` → `--sort-field`, and 21 more. The old concatenated spellings remain valid aliases in 1.2.0 (verified against all 114 renamed flags), so this is a documentation-accuracy change, not a fix for breakage — but `--help` and `--schema` now print the kebab-case form.
- **`omni-admin` Uploads** — `uploads create` / `replace-data` are documented against the new dedicated flags (`--file`, `--model-id`, `--branch-id`/`--branch-name`, `--view-name`) instead of a hand-built `--body`. `--file` takes a **path**, `--branch-id`/`--branch-name` are mutually exclusive, and `--body` on these two commands carries **multipart fields** (binary values are still file paths).
- **`omni-api-conventions` rule — `--schema` section rewritten.** On CLI ≥ 1.2.0 `--schema` works on **every** command, not just body-taking ones, and its output is `{ method, path, args?, queryParams, body, example?, response }`. The `queryParams` list gives the exact flag spelling for each filter; the new `response` section documents the success shape and carries behavioral detail (e.g. `query run`'s default response is an **ndjson stream**, not a single JSON document). Removed the now-false claim that `--schema` "carries no response schema", while keeping the caveat that the runtime — not the spec — is authoritative for exact field paths and accepted enum values.
- **`omni-content-builder`** — the v2 draft workflow now prefers `--body @patch.json` over `--body - < patch.json`: no shell quoting, diffable patches, and client-side JSON validation that reports a byte offset instead of a server-side `400`.
- **`omni-ai-eval` / `omni-admin`** — `--schema` guidance no longer describes it as body-command-only.

**Added**
- **`omni-api-conventions` rule — a CLI ≥ 1.2.0 behavior block** covering `--body @path/to/file.json` with client-side JSON validation; client-side enforcement of required params (`Error: required flag(s) "q" not set`, no API call — affects `content search --q`, `query wait --job-ids`, `models dbt-sync --branch-id`, `models yaml-delete --file-name`, `uploads create --file/--model-id`, `uploads replace-data --file`, `ai-eval runs-list --prompt-set-id`), flagged as a **local usage error** rather than an API rejection so agents don't retry it or misread it as a permissions problem; `--query key=value` as the escape hatch for params the spec doesn't declare; and unknown subcommands now erroring instead of silently printing help — with the caveat that **both still exit 0**, so branch on the message.

### omni-integrations

_Summary: flag-spelling sync with Omni CLI v1.2.0._

**Changed**
- `omni-to-snowflake-semantic-view` and `omni-to-databricks-metric-views` — `omni models yaml-get` / `models list` examples use the kebab-case flag names (`--file-name`, `--model-kind`, `--branch-id`).

## [1.8.0] - 2026-08-20

### omni-analytics

_Summary: sync skills with Omni CLI v1.1.2 (new commands from the spec sync in [exploreomni/cli#71](https://github.com/exploreomni/cli/pull/71)). Command shapes verified against the released CLI via `--help`/`--schema`._

**Added**
- `omni-content-explorer` — free-text dashboard search via `omni content search --q --limit` as the first stop for "find the dashboard about X" (dashboards only; keywords match names, descriptions, query names, folder names, labels, and creator names), and atomic folder label management via `omni folders bulk-update-labels`.
- `omni-admin` — new **AI Credits** section covering `omni ai credit-controls-*` (org, per-user, per-entity-group) and the new usage reads `credit-usage-users-read` / `credit-usage-entity-groups-read`, including the membership-id (not user-id) gotcha. New **Commit Signing Key Rotation** section for `connections dbt-rotate-signing-key` and `models git-rotate-signing-key`, with a confirm-before-rotating caution.
- `omni-ai-optimizer` — new **AI Model Suggestions** section for the `omni ai-model-suggestions` command group (generate runs, list/ignore/restore/delete suggestions, enable/disable the schedule).
- `omni-content-builder` — documented `documents v2-bind-query-model` / `v2-unbind-query-model` in the documents-v2 reference: the draft-scoped route for changing a tile's server-owned query-model binding, with the one-query-model-per-tile and LINKED-tile constraints.
- `omni-model-builder` — documented `omni models branch-dbt-get` for dbt-connected models: reads the dbt environment a branch resolves to, with the default-environment fallback behavior.
- `omni-admin` — new **Uploads** section covering the `omni uploads` group (list/create/delete plus the new `replace-data`, which swaps an upload's data while keeping its id — existing views and document tabs keep working, with a caution on column renames/removals).

## [1.7.0] - 2026-08-20

### omni-analytics

_Summary: build-from-experience hardening across the content/model/query skills; gate "where does a new field live" on the caller's actual access (via `whoami`, with the permission→capability map centralized in `omni-admin`); a `--schema` request-vs-response / "values can drift" clarification; the `rules/` made reachable by **any skill-consuming agent that follows file links** (e.g. Claude Code), not just Cursor (which auto-loads `rules/`); and a behavior-verified rewrite of the query **filter reference** (typed filter objects) with an omni-query / omni-content-builder ownership split — filter *shapes* vs document *controls*._

**Added**
- **`omni-admin` *Model Roles & Caller Access* section** — the canonical `whoami` access check (`QUERY_FULL_MODEL` = proxy for "can branch", `UPDATE` = "can merge/promote", `USE_WORKBOOKS` = "can create content"), plus how to resolve a **membership id**: yourself from `whoami → user.membershipId`, *another* user from `scim users-list` (whose record `id` **is** the membershipId) — a lookup that needs the **org key**, since SCIM rejects user PATs.
- **`omni-content-builder` references** — the two supported markdown data components (`<Sparkline>`/`<ChangeArrow>`) + the KPI `markdownConfig` section types; single-tile downloads (`queryIdentifierMapKey`), early-exit poll loops, and render-failure disambiguation; a `whoami` Step 0 in *Updating a Dashboard's Model* (route reusable fields to a shared-model branch vs the workbook model); and that a tile's `query.controls` can **stack several `MULTI_FIELD_FILTER`s** — each an OR-group, AND-ed together → **AND-of-ORs**.
- **`omni-model-builder`** — a no-query join-exposure check (`get-topic`), and a pre-branch access check in *Safe Development Workflow* (`QUERY_FULL_MODEL` → can branch; `UPDATE` → can merge), pointing at the `omni-admin` map.
- **`omni-query`** — an early-exit agentic poll loop, and the rewritten **filter reference** documents the full typed-filter union (`string`/`number`/`date`/`boolean`/`null`/`composite`/`user_attribute`, each with its `kind`/`ui_type` enums), measure filters → `HAVING` (with the ratio-null trap), the **silent-drop** check (a wrong-props object returns `COMPLETE` but never reaches SQL — verify via `display_sql`/row count), and `documents v2-create --schema` (`queryPresentations.data.query.filters`) as the authoritative filter union.
- **New `omni-permissions` Cursor rule** mirroring the `omni-admin` access check (incl. the org-key requirement for SCIM membership-id lookups).

**Changed**
- **Caller-access gating centralized** — "where a new field lives" is now gated on the caller's actual access via `whoami`; the permission→capability map lives in `omni-admin`, and `omni-content-builder`/`omni-model-builder` defer to it. Role-assignment examples fixed: **`roleName`** (not `role`), path id is the **membership id** (a user id 404s), and `roleName` is a server-validated, non-enumerable string with no list command and no un-assign. Also documents the **Restricted Querier authoring envelope**: workbook-model edits are **view-scoped** (fields on existing views + decorations only — topics/joins/grants need a branch), and **queries are topic-only** (every authored tile must be topic-based; a non-topic / `userEditedSQL` query needs `QUERY_FULL_MODEL`) — so a restricted-querier build doesn't 403 and strand a doc out from under them.
- **Query filters are typed objects, not bare strings (`omni-query`)** — the rewritten `references/filter-expressions.md` replaces the old bare-string shorthand (which is **rejected** — `400 "Unable to parse data stream"` on current Omni; older builds returned `500 "Cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'query_id'…"` from the query-reference probe) with typed objects; it replaces the Known Bugs list with that one reproduced bug (removing the stale `IS_NOT_NULL`→`IS NULL` and boolean-filters-dropped-with-pivots claims), and **scopes the skill to filter *shapes***, handing document-context filters/controls (tab `query.controls`, dashboard `document.controls`, wiring) to `omni-content-builder` — which links back for the shapes.
- **Row count is `cache_metadata.num_rows`** (there is no `summary.row_count`) — corrected in `omni-query` and `omni-content-builder` prose and eval criteria.
- **Model-authoring corrections (`omni-model-builder`)** — filtered measures take an operator object (`{ is: true }`), never a bare scalar (booleans included); `create` takes `modelName` not `name`; refresh a stale schema before treating "not found" as real; window-shaped result columns are table calculations.
- **`--schema` request/response boundary** — covers the request body only (not the response shape) and is authoritative for which fields exist/are required but not always for exact accepted values/casing (the runtime is the source of truth); `dashboards download` / `models create` defer their exhaustive field/enum lists to it.
- **Dashboard-build refinements** (content-builder + omni-query references) — projection run-rate **selects-and-hides** the date measure rather than `allow_refs_to_unselected_fields:true` (an AI-SQL-gen-only marker that renders `#ERROR`/uneditable in the workbook); v2 record keys must be numeric strings and a batched `order` may list only keys already present; calc `format` is a bare string and `known_type` has no `DATE` (use `TIMESTAMP`); a harvest-reconciliation grain check (select+hide referenced fields); AI query-gen (`generate-query`/`job-submit`) runs on shared models only.
- **Rules reachable beyond Cursor** — the by-name references to `omni-api-conventions` across 11 skills are now **resolvable relative-path links**, so the rule is reachable by **any agent that loads the skills and follows file links** (Claude Code and other skill runners) — not only Cursor, which auto-loads `rules/` by convention. `omni-yaml-conventions`/`omni-terminology` reduced to thin pointers to their canonical skills (no duplicated reference content to maintain).
- **`query run` body mechanics (`omni-query`)** — `modelId` goes **inside `query`** and is required on every standalone run (v2 dashboard tiles omit it — don't let the rule cross over); `resultType`/`cache` are **top-level only** (misplaced inside `query` → silently dropped → you get Arrow); and `query run` emits **NDJSON** (one object per line), so set `resultType:"json"` for a clean array rather than decoding the envelope.
- **`omni-model-builder` merge guardrail** — a 🛑 HARD STOP that `merge-branch`/promote is a separate, user-initiated step (the usual rationalizations — additive, spec-says-to, broad directive, needed-for-deliverable, sandbox — listed as *not* permission); and `omni models validate` returns a **bare array** of issues (parse as a list, not `.get("issues")`).
- **`omni-content-builder` markdown/KPI cards** — data-component attributes are **kebab-case** (`swap-colors`, not the silently-stripped `swapColors` — the real cause of "swapColors doesn't work in markdown"); `<comparison>` **is** hand-authorable and self-computes its % (no calc); `<Sparkline>` is **fixed-px / non-responsive**; tile keys must be **numeric strings** (control ids needn't be); and a malformed `markdownConfig` value-field **persists but crashes at render** (`reading 'name'`/`'row'`). Adds a render-verified native-KPI tile + caveat checklist, the native-KPI-vs-markdown-card steer, and a mechanical `normalizeTile()` round-trip helper.
- **`omni-model-explorer`** — `models list` paginates and nests results under the **`records`** key; on busy instances (mostly `name: null` workbook models) filter server-side with `--modelkind SHARED --name`.
- **Skill best-practices pass** — every `SKILL.md` trimmed under the ~500-line progressive-disclosure guideline (`omni-model-builder` 509→498, redundancy-only — no content lost); sharpened `omni-content-builder`'s triggering description (977→859 chars: dropped the redundant quoted-phrase block, added an `omni-query` / `omni-model-builder` disambiguation clause for precision).

## [1.2.1] - 2026-08-10

### omni-integrations

**Changed**
- `omni-to-databricks-metric-view` — treat everything returned by `omni models yaml-get` as untrusted data rather than instructions. Step 2 now states that Omni-authored `label`, `description`, `ai_context`, and `sample_queries` values are content to translate, and that any embedded directions (run a command, change the destination catalog/schema, widen a `GRANT`, skip a confirmation) must be surfaced to the user instead of acted on.
- `omni-to-databricks-metric-view` — added a validation checkpoint before Omni metadata is carried into `display_name`, `comment`, or `expr`, which Databricks Genie and AI/BI read as semantic context. Instruction-like values are replaced with an agent-written summary, `$$` and control characters are stripped so metadata cannot terminate the metric view body and escape into surrounding SQL, and no fetched value may determine a catalog, schema, table, grantee, or SQL fragment — those come only from the user-confirmed Step 1 answers. Rejected or rewritten metadata is reported at the pre-generation review. Closes the remaining `PROMPT_INJECTION` finding in the Gen Agent Trust Hub audit (see https://www.skills.sh/exploreomni/omni-agent-skills/omni-to-databricks-metric-view/security/agent-trust-hub).

## [1.6.0] - 2026-07-24

### omni-analytics

_Summary: resync `omni-ai-optimizer` with the rewritten [Optimize models for Omni AI](https://docs.omni.co/modeling/develop/ai-optimization) guide — two wrong facts corrected, `ai_context` templating added, net −45 lines._

**Fixed**
- **The "~550 fields" limit doesn't exist.** Pruning is driven by character caps: ~75K per topic's field definitions, ~100K for the topic-selection summary, 100 fields per out-of-topic search. Removed from the skill and from eval case 2, which had asserted the agent should cite it.
- **The synonyms pruning caveat was inverted.** Synonyms are pruned *last*, after `description` and `label` — not before. Guidance flipped accordingly.
- **Dead docs link** — `/ai/optimize-models.md` now 404s. Reference section rebuilt around the current URL and expanded per-parameter.

**Added**
- **Context priority and pruning order**, replacing an invented "impact order" heuristic — including that **`ai_context` is never pruned**, so bloated context starves field metadata and can fail the request rather than degrading gracefully.
- **`ai_context` templating** (model/topic/view only): `{{omni_attributes.<name>}}` personalization — with the caveat that dimension/measure `ai_context` does *not* substitute them; `omni_llm` tier scoping; `omni_agent` scoping; `constants` reuse.
- **"Context is guidance, not instruction"** — no reliable model-over-topic precedence, non-deterministic behavior.
- Model-level `ai_context` and `sample_queries`; where context applies beyond Omni Agent; troubleshooting order (topic reachable → field in context → then write `ai_context`); workbook sample-query path and its easily-missed **Include in AI context** checkbox; `ai_fields: [tag:use_for_ai]`; dbt `accepted_values` ingest as `all_values`.
- Frontmatter `description` extended to route on the new surface area (user-attribute personalization, tier/agent scoping, pruning and truncation diagnosis, topic reachability).

**Changed**
- **Redundancy pass.** Synonyms guidance was stated in four places and had become self-contradictory — "pruned last" read as encouragement to add more, against the guardrail not to add them once topic-level `ai_context` already disambiguates. Reconciled: durability is a reason to prefer synonyms *over* a description, never to add more. Also deduplicated "`ai_context` is never pruned" (4× → 1), and cut the multi-language and chain-of-thought recipes, a paragraph restating the Safe Defaults synonyms rule, and two redundant example blocks.
- **Fixed a contradiction in the skill's own example** — the field-description sample enumerated `status` values in `description` while the next subsection prescribed `all_values` for exactly that, on the same field.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-25

### omni-analytics

_Summary: align the CLI guidance with three upstream CLI changes — OAuth browser login, a `--schema` flag for discovering request-body shapes, and a `whoami` identity/permission check — and, centrally, document how to authenticate from an agent session._

**Added**
- **`omni-api-conventions` rule** gains an **"Authenticating from an agent session"** section: `omni config login` / `omni config init --auth oauth` run an OAuth 2.1 + PKCE browser flow that opens a localhost callback and **blocks ~2 minutes**, which a headless agent can't complete. The default is to **hand off** to the user (`! omni config login <profile>`); the agent may run it directly only on a local interactive machine, never in headless/CI. Tokens auto-refresh. Plus a **"Discovering request body shapes"** section for the `--schema` flag (prints a body command's resolved JSON schema + a filled example, no token, no API call; plus the `--depth` and `--field` companions for navigating large schemas like `documents v2-create`) and a **`whoami`** preflight that triages CLI capability, auth, and permissions in one call (`unknown command` → CLI predates 1.0.7, update it; `401`/`403 Invalid bearer token` → OAuth hand-off; identity JSON → proceed) — capability-based detection rather than a brittle `--version` semver gate, plus a minimum-version note (omni ≥ 1.0.7) in the Installation section.
- **All 9 skill prerequisites** now run `omni whoami whoami` to confirm the active profile is authenticated, and carry a compact auth note (API key vs OAuth; hand off on 401; pointer to the rule for `--schema` and `omni config init --auth oauth`).
- **`--schema` discovery examples** in the body-authoring skills (`omni-query`, `omni-content-builder`, `omni-model-builder`, `omni-admin`, `omni-ai-eval`) — pull a command's body schema instead of guessing the JSON for `--body`.
- **Agents** `omni-analyst` and `omni-admin-agent` now begin with a `whoami` auth/permission preflight and the OAuth hand-off path.

**Changed**
- `omni config init` setup guidance reflects upstream: profiles are created with `--name`/`--endpoint`/`--auth`, and the **API key is read from a hidden prompt — never an `--api-key` flag** (which would leak the secret into shell history and process listings).
- `omni-api-conventions` Installation note no longer tells readers to gate on `omni --version` (which would falsely reject custom/dev/`install.sh`-from-`main` builds that carry the features without a release version) — it now points at the same capability probe as the `whoami` preflight, resolving an internal contradiction in the doc.
- `--schema` is now stated as the **source of truth** for request-body field detail; the hardcoded `--body` shapes in `omni-admin` and `documents-v2.md` are framed as worked examples / gotcha carriers that defer to `--schema` for the exhaustive field list. Also corrected the documented `--schema` output shape (the top-level `required` array is present only when the body has required fields).

### omni-integrations

**Added**
- The Databricks and Snowflake integration skills' prerequisites gained the same `omni whoami whoami` auth check and OAuth hand-off note.

## [1.4.3] - 2026-06-25

### omni-analytics

- `omni-model-builder` — hardened the **git-connected models** guidance: author model content through the Omni APIs (CLI) on a branch → `omni models commit` → PR → review/merge in your git provider (the repo is a governance projection, Omni's model state authoritative, never hand-edit model YAML in git); adds the model-content vs. repo-governance boundary and a post-merge verification recipe for net-new topics/views (validated live end-to-end on a git-connected model).

## [1.4.2] - 2026-06-19

### omni-analytics

_Summary: two themes — (1) **governed raw SQL**: reproduce handed-over SQL through topics by default, and gate any non-topic/raw-SQL tile behind an explicit decision plus Access Boost; (2) **dashboard-authoring craft**: a mustache reference, borderless tiles, responsive KPI fonts, run-rate projection overlays, and fanout-safe modeling. Bullets below carry the implementation detail; the skill docs carry the full reference._

**Added**
- `omni-query` documents the **raw-SQL query pathway**: a new *Running Raw SQL (`userEditedSQL`)* section (minimal body with `fields: []`; `rewriteSql: false` for verbatim execution and `dbtMode: true` for Jinja; the SQL-querying permission gate, which fails as `FORBIDDEN` returned as HTTP 200 in the job body, not a 4xx; the 50,000-row cap with a +1 truncation sentinel; warehouse-dialect/fully-qualified-name requirement), plus a *Request-level options* table (`resultType`, `cache`, `userId`, `branchId`, `planOnly`, `formatResults`, `timezone`).
- `omni-admin` adds an **Access Boost** subsection: a **confirm-before-applying checklist** (it loosens access controls — understand what's exposed, confirm intent with the requester, prefer the narrowest scope, never boost reflexively), the role values (`NO_ACCESS`/`VIEWER`/`EDITOR`/`MANAGER`), the org-capability prerequisite (`allowsDocumentAccessBoost` / `allowsMemberToProvisionAccessBoost` — an instance setting, not a CLI op), both per-document levers (`documents add-permits`/`update-permits` with `accessBoost`, and `documents update-permission-settings` with `organizationAccessBoost`), and the **dashboard-only** scope (it does not extend to the underlying workbook's non-topic/SQL tabs).
- `omni-content-builder` adds a **hard rule** for building dashboards from SQL: **never build a non-topic / `userEditedSQL` tile from handed-over SQL without an explicit user decision.** When existing topics don't express the SQL, stop and **ask whether to model it** (extend or create a topic on a branch); a non-topic tile is only built after the user explicitly chooses that path. Non-topic + Access Boost is never the default for handed-over SQL. Plus a **Raw-SQL tiles** recipe in `references/queryPresentations.md` (author the `userEditedSQL` tile → publish → Access Boost) and the audience/Access-Boost prompt: when a tile is non-topic/raw-SQL, ask whether the audience includes Restricted Queriers/Viewers and **recommend** Access Boost (don't silently enable it — confirm intent, narrowest scope). Supports SQL-first dashboard migrations (e.g. from Mode) where a governed topic may not yet exist.
- **Mustache reference** (`omni-content-builder`, new `references/mustache.md`) — the filters-vs-controls namespace split and, centrally, that **filter addressability is context-dependent by tile kind**: a dashboard **text tile** keys filters by control **`id`** (same-field filters stay *separate*), while a markdown **viz tile** keys them by **`view.field`** (same-field filters *collapse* to one composite-OR); controls key by `id` in both, and **Period-over-Period is not addressable in mustache** in any context. Plus the `.value` / `.value_static` / `.raw` distinction (formatted+interactive / formatted / raw — per the Omni docs), the bare-`calc_name` row-level key path for table calculations (mis-nesting under a view silently returns `""`), a conditional-color KPI recipe, and a filter-aware deep link built from a text tile (the viz-tile form drops to empty when two filters share a field).
- **Borderless tiles** (`omni-content-builder`) — `padding: 0` on a `style: "tile"` stack renders a tile edge-to-edge; `hideBorder` is not in the v2 schema (silently stripped), so this is the only programmatic path.
- **Responsive KPI fonts + projection overlays** (`omni-content-builder`) — KPI headline numbers scale to their card via CSS container queries (`cqw`), not the viewport; and a run-rate "ghost column" overlays a bar chart (same-mark bars stack by default — force overlap with `config.color._stack: "overlay"`).
- **`transposed_measures`** (`omni-query`) — folds wide measures into long-form `measure_value` rows, enabling funnels and measures-as-category bars.
- **Fanout-safe dashboards** (`omni-content-builder` / `omni-model-builder`) — wire each tile's date filter to its most-appropriate field, and give every joined view a real `primary_key` so symmetric aggregates don't inflate (a subset measure exceeding its superset is the tell).

**Changed**
- `omni-query` corrects the `table` parameter from required to **Conditional** (a semantic query needs it only when neither `join_paths_from_topic_name` nor `userEditedSQL` is set; the API requires just `modelId` + `fields`), reframes the Fallback note so bare-view and raw-SQL read as one **non-topic** family (topic-scoped access filters / `always_where` apply to neither; raw SQL additionally bypasses object-level access grants), lists `resultType` `csv`/`xlsx`/`json`, and fixes the job-result "strip `userEditedSQL`" rationale (it removes a non-topic query that bypasses topic-scoped controls — not "row-level access controls").
- `omni-query` sets a **topic-first reflex for SQL input**: when handed SQL, reproduce its intent through a topic when a suitable one exists (using `omni-model-explorer` / `omni ai pick-topic` / `generate-query --run-query=false`); fall back to raw `userEditedSQL` only when no topic fits or the user asks to run it as-is — not text-to-SQL passthrough and not force-fitting a topic. Added as a *Safe Defaults* directive and the lead-in to *Running Raw SQL*.
- **`swallow_errors: false` by default** (`omni-query`) when authoring/validating calculations — `true` hides broken calcs as `#ERROR!` cells while the query still reports COMPLETE.
- **Round-trip rule broadened** (`omni-content-builder`) — restoring/reverting/duplicating a tile from a `v2-get` also requires re-nesting the inner spec under `config` (not edit-only); plus legend-label (`title.value`, not `.label`) and cartesian axis-styling corrections.
- **Calc-authoring single-sourced** — `omni-query` owns the table-calculation AST (shape, operator catalog, **agentic-first** harvest via `job-submit` → `actions[].generate_query`); `omni-content-builder` now *defers* to it and keeps only the content-builder-specific facts (a calc renders in a tile only when its `calc_name` is in both `query.fields` and the outer `queryPresentation.fields`; in markdown tiles drive geometry from raw measure tokens + CSS `calc()`, not calc tokens). Markdown-tile recipes split out of `visConfig.md` into `references/markdown-tiles.md`.
- **Agentic-job flow corrected** (`omni-query`) — `omni ai job-status` exposes job state under **`state`** (not `status`; `QUEUED`→`EXECUTING`→`DELIVERING`→`COMPLETE`/`FAILED`/`CANCELLED`), with a tolerant terminal check for poll loops shared across job types (`COMPLETE` vs `COMPLETED` vs lowercase). And the post-harvest `query run` is reframed: the agentic job already executed the calc, so re-running your *assembled* query is a **translation-fidelity** check — diff the values against the job's `csvResult` to catch a dropped/renamed field, not re-prove the math.

**Fixed**
- `omni-content-builder` `references/queryPresentations.md`: corrected the tile `type` field from "Recommended" to **Required** (omitting it 400s), and clarified that dashboard query tiles — **including raw-SQL tiles** — use **`type: "query"`** (a raw-SQL tile is a `query` tile with `userEditedSQL`; `type: "sql"` is a separate content-item kind that renders as "Unknown content item type" on a dashboard, and the `containers` slot child `type` must match). Rewrote the *Raw-SQL tiles* recipe accordingly, including the two render requirements proven by building a live tile and reading it back: a real `visConfig` **and** `query.fields` populated with the SQL's result column ids (not `[]`); `join_paths_from_topic_name` must be `""` not `null`. Added a *Known Issues* note that a tile with a null `visConfig` renders as "Item missing" (a vis-config gap, not a `containers` gap).

**Evals**
- `omni-query`: topic-first reproduction of handed-over SQL (no `userEditedSQL`), explicit-verbatim raw SQL (`rewriteSql: false`), and the unbounded-raw-SQL 50k row cap. `omni-content-builder`: SQL-first migration tile (self-contained `v2-create`) + proactive Access Boost prompt.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-06-16

### omni-analytics

**Changed**
- `omni-content-builder` `references/documents-v2.md`: document the `--body` object-vs-string footgun — `queryPresentations`/`controls`/`settings` must be **nested objects, not stringified JSON** (the `400 … expected object, received string` error), with a worked body example and an error-map row; add an inline callout distinguishing `v2-patch-draft` (opens a draft) from `v2-patch-draft-by-identifier` (pure apply on an existing draft).
- `omni-content-builder` `references/branch-bound-drafts.md`: name the running-total table-calculation AST shape (`Omni.OMNI_FX_SUM(Omni.OMNI_OFFSET_MULTI(...))`, `sql_expression` not a workbook-style `{name, formula}`) and note the full operator catalog lives in the `omni-query` skill.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-12

### omni-analytics

**Changed**
- `omni-content-builder` migrated document create/edit to the GA **v2 documents API** (requires a CLI release with the `documents v2-*` commands — exploreomni/cli#62). Creation is `documents v2-create`; every edit rides the **draft flow** (`v2-get` → `v2-patch-draft` → validate the draft → `v2-publish-draft`), replacing the v1 `documents create`/`put` full-replacement path. Patches **merge by key** (null deletes; `order` arrays and `containers` replace wholesale), so updates no longer resend the whole document, and failed edits roll back by discarding the draft — the published dashboard is never touched. v1 commands remain for lifecycle ops (list/delete/move/duplicate/get-queries/list-drafts/discard-draft), downloads, workbook-model YAML, and workbook-model-ID discovery; a command boundary table routes between the generations.
- All behaviors live-verified against a GA instance with a CLI built from exploreomni/cli#62, including: the flat-read/nested-write inner vis-config asymmetry (a flat-sent spec silently keeps only `visType` — the round-trip footgun), tile queries carrying **no `modelId`** (a sent value is silently rewritten; the server anchors tiles to the workbook model), **workbook-model rotation** on every draft publish (extensions carry over; never cache the ID), the required query collection-field set (400 with per-field errors), seed-tile `"1"` merge on create, multi-tile create laying out only tile `"1"`, filter `map` per-tile scoping now working (switcher `map` still UI-only), `branchId` binding only from the JSON body (`--body` silently drops all shorthand flags), `v2-publish-draft` being main-draft-only (branch drafts publish via branch merge), and the 422 classic-layout rejection with no API fallback.
- References restructured: `documents-v2.md`/`containers.md`/`controls.md` (initially authored by Scott Barber against the experimental surface) refreshed for GA and promoted to the primary path; `updating-dashboards.md` rewritten around the draft loop with merge-by-key recipes and a live-verified error map; `branch-bound-drafts.md` rewritten — the v1 `query.modelId`-stamping gotcha is gone, replaced by body-`branchId` + `list-drafts` binding verification; `queryPresentations.md`/`visConfig.md` re-enveloped (`visConfig: {chartType, fields, version, visConfig: {visType, config}}`) with a v1→v2 field-location table; `filterConfig.md` folded into `controls.md` (filters and controls are one keyed `controls` slice); `validation-and-testing.md` re-pointed at validating the draft **before** publishing.
- Eval cases re-targeted to the draft flow: merge-by-key tile additions (no full-document resend), nested-under-`config` vis specs with flat-readback verification, the no-`modelId` workbook-field flow, body-`branchId` branch binding with `list-drafts` verification, and controls-slice filters.

## [1.3.18] - 2026-06-02

### omni-analytics

**Changed**
- `omni-model-builder` adds branch-editing guidance to the Safe Development Workflow (`yaml-create` is a whole-file write; inspecting a branch via `yaml-get` — `extension` = changed files, `combined` = full composed model) and "new topic vs extend" criteria (different subject/base view, always-applied constraints, or audience/labels), noting that querying on a topic is what exposes results to restricted queriers/viewers.
- `omni-query` adds topic-first guidance and now owns the canonical topic-query shape: prefer querying a topic (`table` = base view + `join_paths_from_topic_name`); the **join-map mechanics** (how `join_paths_from_topic_name` reaches joined-view fields from the base view, verified via `get-topic`'s `base_view_name`/`join_via_map`) — `omni-content-builder` and `omni-model-builder` now reference this instead of restating it; a use-existing / extend / new-topic decision flow; the access-control consequence (non-topic queries are invisible to restricted queriers/viewers); the bare-base-view fallback; and a handoff to `omni-model-builder` for topic changes.
- `omni-content-builder` adds field-placement guidance: a "where a new field belongs" decision order in *Updating a Dashboard's Model* (table calculation → shared-model branch → workbook model; never the schema model) and `references/branch-bound-drafts.md` for tiles whose query references a field not in the *published* shared model — the restricted-querier "Invalid model" gotcha (`documents create` stamps the base model on tiles) and its `documents put` workbook-model fix, covering both branch-only fields (warning) and workbook-model fields (the field *fails to resolve* unless `query.modelId` is the workbook model), the fixed `create` → `get` → `yaml-create … mode:extension` → `put` order, and draft tiles using the draft's own workbook model which extends its branch. Also tells the agent to flag the pending-merge draft status to the creator (a branch-bound draft only publishes when its branch merges), notes drafts link via `/dashboards/<draftIdentifier>`, and adds eval cases (workbook-field tiles, branch-bound-draft tiles, running-total-as-calculation routing).

## [1.3.17] - 2026-06-02

### omni-analytics

**Fixed**
- `omni-content-builder` visualization config guidance: the rendering spec belongs in a queryPresentation-level `visConfig.config` with `chartType` as a sibling — a bare top-level `config` was silently dropped and `query.visConfig.chartType` alone does not drive a tile. A correctly-shaped `documents create`/`put` now reliably one-shots a styled chart.
- Corrected the `chartType` enum (removed invalid `barColor`/`areaColor`/`stackedBarColor`/`scatter`; documented the real enum and the column-vertical vs bar-horizontal distinction) and `configType` values (`cartesian`/`polar`/`heatmap`/`boxplot`; pie is `polar`; funnel/sankey/map carry no `configType`).
- Corrected per-family shapes verified against a live instance: `regionMap` uses `visType: map` + `regionType: us-states`/`countries` + a `sourceProperty` matching the field's values (plus `center`/`zoom`); `svgMap` requires both `svgContent` and `mapName`; funnel uses `orient`/`funnelAlign`/`sort`; `auto` is not a persistable render; markdown is mustache-templated; AI-summary uses `ai_context`/`showWarning`; `summaryValue` is deprecated in favor of `kpi`.
- `omni-content-builder` dashboard-update guidance now uses the `omni documents put <identifier>` CLI command (full replacement) instead of a raw `curl PUT` with a manual auth header — the prior text incorrectly stated full-document replacement was not available in the CLI.
- `omni-model-builder` corrected invalid `${TABLE}.column` examples (a LookML-ism that does not resolve in Omni) to proper `${field}` references. _(Merged previously without a version bump; documented here.)_

**Changed**
- Added `omni-content-builder` eval cases (stacked column, heatmap, pie) asserting valid `chartType`, spec-in-`visConfig.config`, correct `configType`, and read-back-confirms-persistence.
- `omni-model-builder` SKILL.md trimmed under the ~500-line guideline by extracting schema-refresh and validation/testing detail into `references/schema-refresh.md` and `references/validation-and-testing.md`. _(Merged previously without a version bump; documented here.)_

## [1.3.16] - 2026-05-25

### omni-analytics

**Changed**
- `omni-query` now treats explicit table-calculation requests as a strict `calculations[]` workflow, avoiding existing model fields, raw SQL/window fallbacks, or client-side calculations when the user asks for calculated columns.
- `omni-query` now adds stricter reporting and reference-routing guidance for running totals, moving averages, pivot row totals, tier labels, date differences, SUM_IF broadcasts, VLOOKUP fallbacks, and month-over-month percent change.

## [1.3.15] - 2026-05-25

### omni-analytics

**Changed**
- `omni-model-builder` now handles schema-impact checks on connections that reject branch-based schema refresh by falling back to shared schema refresh while continuing branch-scoped validation/content validation where supported.
- `omni-model-builder` now separates validation warnings from dashboard blast-radius results and avoids inferring that join-path warnings were caused by an unspecified deleted column.
- `omni-content-builder` now treats `config: {}` as a table/fallback pattern and directs requested line/bar/area/scatter/KPI charts to use complete chart-specific config from the visualization references.
- `omni-content-builder` now distinguishes normal new-dashboard readback omissions from failed existing-dashboard partial updates, and requires explicit per-tile status/row-count verification after creation.
- `omni-ai-optimizer` now stops after verifying complete topic-level term mappings instead of adding redundant field synonyms as extra signal.

**Fixed**
- Eval reset now removes accidentally merged `eval_completed_revenue` model-builder fixtures, repairs known quote-stripped literals in `public/order_items.view`, and deletes stale branch models using a direct branch listing.

## [1.3.14] - 2026-05-24

### omni-analytics

**Changed**
- `omni-model-builder` now explicitly keeps prepared branch changes unmerged until the user confirms merge/publish, and reports no dashboard breakage when schema refresh plus content validation find no affected content.
- `omni-content-builder` now clarifies that `documents get-queries` and query execution verify only data queries, not persisted visualization renderer/config fields, so dropped KPI/chart presentation fields still require rollback/reporting.
- `omni-admin` now distinguishes user attribute definitions from per-user assigned values, verifies assigned values through SCIM user readback, and treats explicit set/update requests as idempotent updates.
- `omni-model-explorer` now gives the correct branch-scoped `yaml-create --body` pattern for impact checks and clarifies that dependent field references should remain so validation can reveal breakage.
- BenchFlow-generated judges now compact ACP trajectory evidence before truncation so long rollouts preserve every tool call title and final response context for scoring.

**Fixed**
- Eval reset/preflight now checks and deletes both `public/customer_segments.view` and root-level `customer_segments.view` fixtures left by model-builder runs.

## [1.3.13] - 2026-05-23

### omni-analytics

**Changed**
- `omni-ai-optimizer` now emphasizes branch-first model writes, reading existing YAML before writing, and keeping topic-level optimization requests on topic-level parameters when appropriate.
- `omni-content-builder` now bounds failed existing-dashboard update attempts: after a server-side document write-path error, agents should stop after one corrected retry, preserve the original dashboard, and report the blocker instead of cycling through import/export, draft, replacement-dashboard, or repeated filter-probing attempts.
- `omni-content-builder` now documents raw API URL normalization with `${OMNI_BASE_URL%/}` and treats dropped readback visualization fields as partial dashboard update blockers.
- `omni-embed` now explicitly forbids substituting `OMNI_API_TOKEN` for the embed secret and tells agents to return SDK-shaped `embedSsoDashboard()` code when `OMNI_EMBED_SECRET` is unavailable.
- The content-builder evals now account for current Omni response shapes: row counts can appear as `cache_metadata.num_rows`, query-level filter validation can hit server-side filter errors, and add-tile updates can partially persist while dropping presentation config.
- The eval runner now performs read-only remote preflight checks before starting BenchFlow for cases with known mutable Omni fixtures, failing before any LLM tokens are spent when those fixtures are dirty.
- BenchFlow-generated judges now score long trajectories using both the beginning and end of the transcript instead of only the first 50,000 characters, reducing false failures when early tool output is large.
- `omni-ai-optimizer` evals now reflect idempotent setup-aware behavior: agents should verify existing `ai_context` and `sample_queries` instead of duplicating them, and should only curate `ai_fields` when the topic is actually near the AI-visible field limit.
- `omni-embed` evals now distinguish solid-color requirements from valid rgba shadow values and account for missing embed secrets.
- `omni-model-builder` now directs deleted-column impact checks through branch schema refresh, branch validation, and content-validator before asking for clarification or recommending a merge, and gives a concrete filtered-measure `filters:` pattern.
- `omni-admin` now documents env credential fallback, idempotent create verification, real document permit commands (`documents add-permits`/`access-list`), and the current schedule creation body shape.
- `omni-content-explorer` now documents label filtering via `documents list --include labels` because `content list --labels` is not supported, and treats dashboard export failures before job creation as blockers to report rather than completed downloads.
- `omni-model-explorer` now requires verified branch setup before interpreting field-removal blast-radius results and reports full topic AI context, including `sample_queries` and `ai_fields` when configured.
- `omni-ai-eval` now makes query-generation-only quick evals explicit and tightens branch comparison guidance to score main and branch outputs against the same criteria.
- `omni-query` now gives direct table-calculation recipes for percent-of-total, SUM_IF, VLOOKUP-style, and month-over-month calculations, and tells agents to show enough query JSON to verify calc fields are rendered.
- Eval history exports now include a runner-level `run_id`; older summaries without one are backfilled with `legacy-*` ids by grouping near-simultaneous skill workspaces.

**Docs**
- Documented that `EVAL_DASHBOARD_TILES` is a mutable eval fixture and should be recreated before rerunning the content-builder add-tile case after a successful or partial run.

## [1.3.12] - 2026-05-23

### omni-analytics

**Changed**
- `omni-ai-eval` now defines how to handle quick eval requests that provide prompts without golden expected query JSON: infer expected topic, fields, filters, sorts, and limits from prompt intent, score those dimensions explicitly, and avoid treating the run as a valid-query-only smoke test.
- Tightened the first `omni-ai-eval` eval rubric to match that quick-eval behavior and require dimension-level scoring.

**Fixed**
- BenchFlow-generated LLM judges now print their parsed JSON result to verifier stdout so failed or partial scores expose the rubric item decisions and reasoning in run artifacts.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-05-23

### omni-integrations

**Changed**
- `omni-to-databricks-metric-view` — replaced `cat ~/.databrickscfg` with `databricks auth profiles` so the skill no longer instructs the agent to read a credentials file. Replaced the shell-substituted `python3 -c '...'` JSON-encoding step in the SQL Statements API call with a `--json @payload.json` pattern, dropping the extra interpreter and shell substitution of generated SQL. Brings the Gen Agent Trust Hub audit profile closer to the Snowflake peer skill (see https://www.skills.sh/exploreomni/omni-agent-skills/omni-to-databricks-metric-view/security/agent-trust-hub).

## [1.3.11] - 2026-05-22

### omni-analytics

**Added**
- `omni-query` SKILL.md — prefer `job-submit` over `generate-query` for calc-bearing prompts (more reliable SQL fallback; validated by 22-prompt bake-off). Updated "When to Use Which Approach" table. `generate-query --run-query=false` retained as the AST-inspection tool.
- `omni-query` SKILL.md + new `references/job-result-to-presentation.md` — transformation algorithm for converting job results into dashboard `queryPresentations`: always strip `userEditedSQL` (bypasses `always_where_sql` and access controls); when `calculations[]` is empty, reconstruct invented fields from `csvResultFields` using `extension_model_id + expr.type == "call"` as the discriminator; skip aggregate top-level operators (filtered measures, not table calcs); inject missing field refs. Sanity-check approach via extension model YAML documented.

## [1.3.10] - 2026-05-21

### omni-analytics

**Added**
- `skills/omni-query/references/table-calculations.md` — new reference for authoring the `calculations[]` array: wire shape, AST node types, operator catalog (`Omni.*` and `SqlStdOperatorTable.*` namespaces), `OMNI_OFFSET_MULTI` operand decoding, and 12 worked examples (ratio, % of total, running total, chained calcs, CASE, moving average, IFS/concat/TEXT labels, inside-pivot running total, outside-pivot row total, DATEDIF, SUMIF/SUM_IF, VLOOKUP).
- `omni-query` SKILL.md — "Table Calculations" subsection covering the minimum calc shape, the `calc_name`-must-be-in-`fields` gotcha, template operators, and pivot semantics (`outside_pivot`, `limit: null` error).
- 9 new evals (entries 5–13) covering running total, moving average, pivot row total, IFS/AMPERSAND, % of total, DATEDIF operand order, SUM_IF underscore, VLOOKUP 4-operand decomposition, and MoM % change without period-pivot sidestep.

## [1.3.9] - 2026-05-20

### omni-analytics

**Fixed**
- Documented that `omni models yaml-create` treats `fileName` as an exact path identity (not a regex, unlike `yaml-get`): a non-matching name silently creates a new file at the repo root and still returns `success: true`, producing a duplicate view instead of editing the intended one. The `omni-model-builder` write step now instructs reusing the full-path key from the read response verbatim (incl. folder prefixes), adds a post-write anti-duplicate read-back check, and a Common Validation Errors row. `omni-model-explorer` now documents that the `files` map is keyed by full stored path.

**Changed**
- Trimmed redundancy in `omni-model-builder` (overlapping schema-refresh/troubleshooting content, duplicated layering prose, bullet lists) to keep the skill near the ~500-line length guidance. No behavior change.

## [1.3.8] - 2026-05-05

### omni-analytics

**Added**
- `omni models commit` integration (CLI PR [exploreomni/cli#54](https://github.com/exploreomni/cli/pull/54)) for shipping branch changes through a pull request on git-connected models. Step 3 of the omni-model-builder workflow now branches on `omni models git-get <modelId>`: git-connected models use `omni models commit` to open or update a PR (returning `pr_url`); non-git models use `omni models merge-branch` as before. Same guidance added to the `omni-modeler` agent and `omni-yaml-conventions` rule.

## [1.3.7] - 2026-05-04

### omni-analytics

**Added**
- Topic-scoped relationship guidance: `relationships:` parameter inline in a `.topic` file, when to use it over global relationships, `joins` vs `relationships` distinction; YAML gallery in `references/topic-scoped-relationships.md`
- Extended views pattern for same-table aliasing: replaces `join_to_view_as` with `extends: [base_view]`; Variant 1 global `.view` file, Variant 2 topic-scoped inline. Fixes `relationship alias duplicates view name` error
- Topic-scoped view definitions: display ordering, label overrides, filtered measures, derived dimensions, cross-view fields, multi-join lifecycle, ratio measures; YAML gallery in `references/topic-scoped-views.md`
- Pre-check directives for topic-scoped fields and relationships (cross-view reference validation, redundancy/conflict checks, override confirmation)
- Query view primary key guidance: prompt for unique key before writing; `primary_key: true` and `custom_compound_primary_key_sql` documented with fanout error link; YAML gallery in `references/query-view-examples.md`
- `${view_name}` syntax preferred over hard-coded `CATALOG.SCHEMA.TABLE` in `sql:` query view blocks
- Measure filter examples in `references/yaml-filter-syntax.md`, including `not: null` (IS NOT NULL) and `is: null` (IS NULL)

**Fixed**
- Restructured "Writing Relationships" to clearly separate global (shared model) from topic-scoped relationship definitions
- Cross-view fields warning: clarifies that defining `${view_name.field_name}` references in a shared view file causes validator errors in every topic that includes the view without joining the referenced view — these fields belong in the topic's `views:` block
- SKILL.md refactored to keep all agent directives inline while moving YAML pattern galleries to `references/`; conceptual illustrations (schema layer vs extension layer) kept in SKILL.md
- Null check examples in `references/yaml-filter-syntax.md` use generic `some_field` for consistency
- Branch validation pattern corrected: `omni ai job-submit --branch-id --topic-name` correctly resolves branch-scoped topics; `omni query run` supports `branchId` via `--body`

## [1.3.6] - 2026-05-01

### omni-analytics

**Fixed**
- Embedded the lazy-load fallback pattern directly in omni-model-builder rather than cross-referencing omni-model-explorer. Adds a dedicated "Fallback: View Missing from yaml-get" section with the full two-step recovery commands (`get-schemas` + `yaml-get --includeschemas`), and a pre-flight directive in Writing Topics to run the fallback before concluding a view doesn't exist.

## [1.3.5] - 2026-04-29

### omni-analytics

**Fixed**
- Expanded topic key elements in omni-model-builder to include all four always-filter variants (`always_where_sql`, `always_where_filters`, `always_having_sql`, `always_having_filters`) with clear distinction between SQL expression and filter specification forms
- Replaced incomplete 7-item measure filter condition list with a pointer to the new `yaml-filter-syntax.md` reference (which includes `greater_than_or_equal_to`, `less_than_or_equal_to`, negation, array values, boolean handling, and date/time operators)
- Added guidance to use `omni ai search-omni-docs` when filter configuration for topics is unclear

**Added**
- `skills/omni-model-builder/references/yaml-filter-syntax.md` — comprehensive YAML filter operator reference covering all operator categories (conditional, numeric, string, date/time), negation, array values, boolean three-state logic, and field qualification rules for topic vs. measure context

## [1.3.4] - 2026-04-24

### omni-analytics

**Added**
- Schema-aware lazy-load fallback pattern in omni-model-explorer § Fallback: Expected View Missing from `yaml-get`. When normal exploration can't find a view the user named, it's likely in an offloaded or inactive schema. Fallback uses `omni models get-schemas <modelId>` to surface all schemas (including offloaded/inactive) and `omni models yaml-get <modelId> --includeschemas <schema>` to load views from one of them.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-04-23

### omni-analytics

**Changed**
- Replaced env-var auth setup (`export OMNI_BASE_URL` / `export OMNI_API_TOKEN`) with CLI profile workflow (`omni config show` → `omni config use`) across all skills, README, AGENTS.md, and rules
- Added `-o` / `--format` flag guidance to all skills for controlling JSON vs human-readable output

## [1.3.2] - 2026-04-22

### omni-analytics

**Fixed**
- Corrected CLI flag names across all skills to match actual `omni` CLI flags — the CLI is inconsistent with hyphenation per subcommand, so each flag was verified individually
- `--branchid` (no hyphen): `models validate`, `models yaml-get`
- `--branch-id` (with hyphen): `models refresh`, `models get-topic`, `models content-validator-get`, `ai generate-query`
- `--filename`, `--sortfield`, `--creatorid`, `--userid`, `--jobids` (all no hyphen)
- `--clear-existing-draft` requires a string value (e.g. `true`), not a bare flag

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-21

### omni-analytics

**Fixed**
- Removed invalid `views: <view_name>:` wrapper from content builder `yaml-create` example — the API rejects it with `saveError: "Invalid property name at \"views\""`. The YAML body must start directly at `dimensions:` / `measures:`.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-21

### omni-analytics

**Added**
- Eval framework for all 9 Omni skills (`evals/` directory with runner, scorer, and per-skill `evals.json`)
- Comprehensive `visConfig` reference doc for content builder
- Validation loops to model-builder, admin, query, and content builder skills
- Migration note for users coming from deprecated repos

**Changed**
- AI optimizer skill updated for AI topic optimization
- Replaced CLI auto-install with check-and-prompt behavior across all skills
- Updated skills to use CLI shorthand syntax
- Rebranded AI assistant / query helper terminology
- Updated Omni Agent context and values
- Removed `svgMap`, `code`, and `omni-spreadsheet` chart types from visConfig reference

**Fixed**
- Clarified workbook model update flow in content builder
